Which is sort of akin to the process of being a human being, even if you aren&#8217;t a writer. . . . And seriously, what is writing, other than telling stories about being a human being?&quot;--Daniel Ehrenhaft</i><br><br><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><br><br>If there&#8217;s one thing you can say about Daniel Ehrenhaft&#8211;aside from the fact that he&#8217;s worn the same corduroys for the past eleven years&#8211;it&#8217;s that he has a difficult time writing about himself.  So when Random House asked him to contribute a little autobiography for this Website, he was naturally apprehensive.  <br><br>At first, he decided to do some research on the subject of autobiography.  He referred to this very site to read what other Random House authors had written about themselves.  It didn&#8217;t help.  For starters, he discovered that all these authors led fascinating, productive lives. To make matters worse, they all offered trenchant insight about what it means to be a writer. <br><br>As far as Mr. Ehrenhaft can tell, his own life as a writer boils down to a six-part regimen:<br><br>1) Drinking cheap coffee<br>2) Procrastinating (fiddling with the stereo, playing air guitar, etc.)<br>3) Reading a lot. Often, he&#8217;ll read something brilliant or moving or hilarious by someone he&#8217;s never read before, someone whose words end up blowing his mind&#8211;which is followed by<br>4) Jealousy and panic <br>5) Lunch  <br>6) A nap<br><br>But, in a strange way, this process does eventually inspire him to put pen to paper. (Or his fingertips to the computer keyboard, as it were.) After all, he knows what it&#8217;s like to be scared, and to put things off, and to worry about opening up to perfect strangers.  Which is sort of akin to the process of being a human being, even if you aren&#8217;t a writer. <br><br>And seriously, what <i>is</i> writing, other than telling stories about being a human being?  If that sounds evasive and simplistic&#8230;well, maybe it is.  On the other hand, that&#8217;s probably why a lot of writers do what they do.  They open up in their stories in ways that&#8211;at their best&#8211;illuminate truths and complexities not only about themselves, but about their readers, as well.  They write precisely so they don&#8217;t have to be evasive, which is what makes reading such a blast.  <br><br>So really, Daniel Ehrenhaft just writes because he loves to read, and he aspires to do what all his favorite authors have done for him.  In fact, if he had it his way, he would get <i>paid</i> to read.  Then again, if he had it his way, he and his wife would live in a huge castle with a billiards room and a pool shaped like a figure eight, and a custom-made electric guitar signed by the surviving members of The Clash.  <br><br>Until that happens, though, he&#8217;ll probably keep writing.",,,

Among her earliest acquaintances were cows, goats, ducks, chickens, rabbits, dogs, cats, and horses. In fact, her family&rsquo;s animals were her closest friends, and a nearby library was a constant source of magic, adventure, and excitement for her.&nbsp;

Snyder attended Whittier College in Southern California, which awarded her an honorary doctorate. There she also met her future husband, Larry Snyder. While ultimately planning to be a writer, after graduation Snyder decided to teach school temporarily. But she found teaching to be an extremely rewarding experience and taught in the upper elementary grades for a total of nine years, three of them as a master teacher for the University of California at Berkeley.&nbsp;

In the early sixties, when all of her children were finally in school, Snyder began to think about writing again. &ldquo;Writing for children hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me when I was younger, but nine years of teaching in the upper elementary grades had given me a deep appreciation of the gifts and graces that are specific to individuals with 10 or 11 years of experience as human beings. Remembering a dream I&rsquo;d had when I was 12 years old about some strange and wonderful horses, I sat down and began to write.&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>Season of Ponies</i>, Snyder&rsquo;s first book, was published in 1964.

Basically, it&#8217;s like a multiple choice test except you have four choices and one of them is a total lie&#8211;the others are true&#8230;The point of the game is to figure out which one is a total lie . . . what&#8217;s that? You wish you could play right now? Well, goody because I think that&#8217;s much more fun than a dry bio&#8211;plus you could win big prizes (that&#8217;s a lie), but you&#8217;ll have the invigorating experience of being right. And really when it comes down to it, how can a new car beat being right? <br><br>We&#8217;ll start off easy to get you warmed up. First set: 1) Amber Kizer is my real name; 2) I live on an island; 3) I have a rooster named Fabio; 4) I have parakeets named Chirp and Pecker<br><br>Think you know which one is false? Say it out loud, no cheating! Ready? I do not have a penname, which means Amber Kizer is, in fact, my real name (although, I have considered writing under the name J.K. Rowling, just because it has such a catchy ring to it). I do live on an island. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not a gorgeous tropical island. It&#8217;s in the Pacific Northwest where gray skies and green trees (thanks to the rain!) are the most popular colors. I do have a rooster named Fabio. He is named after a very famous cover model for romance novels&#8211;the human Fabio is beefy, doesn&#8217;t own t-shirts, and has long blond hair he swings around seductively. The chicken Fabio isn&#8217;t beefy (tastes like chicken), doesn&#8217;t own t-shirts, and has long blond feathers, which he does indeed throw around like he&#8217;s in front of a wind machine. I do not have parakeets because I don&#8217;t like cages and in my mind having parakeets is one step away from wearing housecoats, lycra in public, and owning 50 cats, all named Sweetie. <br><br>It&#8217;s going to get harder . . . 1) I make wedding cakes for fun; 2) I love reality TV&#8211;especially dating shows; 3) I have four kids and am married; 4) I don&#8217;t miss a minute of March Madness basketball if I can help it.<br><br>Think you know? I do make wedding cakes for fun, and birthday cakes, and I love you cakes, and cakes of all kinds. I love to bake. If you want to see photos of cakes I&#8217;ve made just visit my Web site at AmberKizer.com. I do love reality TV&#8211;and especially dating shows, the raunchier it is, the funnier and the better it is. Please don&#8217;t hold this against me, I&#8217;m in therapy to break the addiction! I adore college hoops and try not to miss any of the tournaments&#8211;men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s. I&#8217;m not married and don&#8217;t have kids&#8211;I&#8217;m young and, while I do hope those things are in my future somewhere way down the line, they&#8217;re on the wish list rather than in the cart. I am, however, in stock and ready to ship. <br><br>All right, I&#8217;m done being nice to you. Here&#8217;s a hard one: 1) I read 15&#8212;20 books concurrently; 2) I quilt; 3) Roses are my favorite flower; 4) I collect amber jewelry when I travel.<br><br>I do read a huge, high stack of books all at the same time&#8211;it keeps it interesting. There&#8217;s too much to learn in the world to read one from start to finish. So I read a chapter, change books, read a chapter and so on, until whatever I&#8217;m reading is so compelling I have to finish the book. Pretty much any topic is game, but I stay away from math theory and computer programming because they just give me a headache. I do quilt&#8211;I love working with colors and fabrics. I don&#8217;t quilt as often as I&#8217;d like because these hands are usually wrung dry from typing, but yum, it feeds my creative soul to stitch fabrics together. Roses are a favorite, but my ultimate favorite flowers are lilies&#8211;Casablanca white ones, Stargazer pinks, any of the really fragrant lilies&#8211;the scent makes my soul smile. So that was kinda a trick one because, of course, I collect amber jewelry. I love it and it looks good with my coloring, so it&#8217;s a win win. <br><br>Now, to the super-duper difficult ones: 1) I&#8217;ve wanted to be a writer since I could talk; 2) I wrote my first book at the age of five called &#8220;Wiggle Me, Tiggle Me&#8221;; 3) I only write when my muse taps me on the shoulder; 4) I don&#8217;t have to do much editing; it&#8217;s usually close to perfect the first time around.<br><br>Think you know? Ha ha, changed it up&#8211;they&#8217;re all LIES! LIES, LIES, LIES! Okay, so maybe that wasn&#8217;t fair, but it was fun. I always wanted to be a criminal prosecuting attorney and eventually a Supreme Court Justice. (Can you spell <i>overachiever</i> anyone?) But I played basketball fervently, and over the course of high school, I ended up with some fairly nasty injuries to my feet and legs. Those led to surgeries, which then gave room to a rare nerve disorder. I developed symptoms at age 18 and it totally and completely sucks (just telling it like it is). In the simplest of terms, the system that controls pain signals, temperature, circulation, and all that very important stuff is corrupted to the point that it&#8217;s wrong all the time&#8211;which means my legs hurt all the time and don&#8217;t always work for me when I ask them to. So this means my life has to be fairly fluid&#8211;I can not tell you how many plans I&#8217;ve had to cancel, how many shows I&#8217;ve given away tickets to, how many great ideas I&#8217;ve had to say &#8220;sorry&#8221; to. I know someone loves me when I say I&#8217;m hurting and they show up with ice cream and a video when we were supposed to go out. This also means that I can&#8217;t count on my legs to have a structured 9 to 5 job (although I&#8217;d love to do any number of things on a consistent basis), so I had to figure out a career that was flexible and that I could do on the good days, or from a horizontal position on the bad ones. A friend invited me to a workshop she was giving on how to teach writing to kids. I did all the activities, and I was hooked on storytelling. I came away from that six weeks with six pages of a story. I wanted to know the ending, so I kept writing. <br><br>Oh, and I should probably tell you that I started in adult romances. Yes, that&#8217;s right, I <i>love</i> romances and they&#8217;re completely a hoot to write&#8211;a hopeless romantic, I adore happy endings and who doesn&#8217;t like hot, steamy, monkey s---socks. Monkey socks.  So I wrote one book, then another, then another. The whole time I was learning what I could about the craft&#8211;it&#8217;s like wanting to be a great artist you need to know the techniques and tools of the craft, and you have to practice. I also spent a great deal of time learning the business end of things&#8211;how agents work, how publishing works, what to expect, what to do right, and what to avoid doing at all costs. There&#8217;s so much to learn I&#8217;m convinced I will never know it all. But I worked my way up the scale from form letter rejections to handwritten notes to long, involved letters asking for revisions. <br><br>I was working on my fourth romance when a voice in my head started giving editorial input. &#8220;He put his hand where? That so wouldn&#8217;t happen . . . eeewww.&#8221; And on and on. Meet Gert. She had things to say and I desperately needed her to shut up, so I opened a new word document and went at it. I figured I&#8217;d let her go until she ran out of steam and then I could get back to the real writing. I guessed 20 pages tops before she ran out of things to say. That was 2005 and she&#8217;s still going. Nothing is off limits, she talks about everything&#8211;even the stuff parents hope their kids don&#8217;t know about. <i>One Butt Cheek</i> is the first in her series&#8211;the second <i>From Butt to Booty</i> comes out next fall.<br><br>I always edit. I always rewrite. And there are no such things as <i>muses</i> unless you use that as a synonym for <i>discipline</i> or <i>perseverance</i>. <br><br>My advice for anyone who thinks they want to be a writer is to hang glide. No, again that&#8217;s not the truth, but it sounds way more interesting than the truth, which is to . . . um . . . write. Also get good at surviving rejection because you have to. Because you have to put yourself out there all the time and learn how to shake it off and do it all over again the next day. You won&#8217;t get published if you don&#8217;t send it out. And you won&#8217;t get published if you send out crap that you haven&#8217;t perfected to the best of your ability. But it&#8217;s not easy, it&#8217;s not pain free and it&#8217;s not for the weak of spirit. It&#8217;s hard, competitive, and everyone thinks because they type out e-mails that writing a book can&#8217;t be much harder than that. Oh yeah, everyone thinks they could write the next bestseller without breaking a sweat, everyone thinks they&#8217;re a writer&#8211;just know that up front. <br><br>So here&#8217;s my advice&#8211;it&#8217;s really good practice to ask the cute boy out, call the girl who you&#8217;ve been crushing on since sixth grade, make yourself available and vulnerable. Because here&#8217;s the deal, they might say yes, they might have been enamored of you for ages, too. Because you could get the call that says, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a contract offer on your book!&#8221; Or at the very least you&#8217;ll have some soul-wrenching real-life experience to write about and that, my friends, is the truth and nothing but the truth. So help me Gert.",,,

100,100,True,Rudy,Rudy Wiebe,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/33129,Wiebe,False,"Rudy Wiebe was born on October 4, 1934, in an isolated farm community of about 250 people in a rugged but lovely region near Fairholme, Saskatchewan. His parents had escaped Soviet Russia with five children in 1930, part of the last generation of homesteaders to settle the Canadian West, and part of a Mennonite history of displacement and emigration through Europe and Asia to North and South America since the seventeenth century. In 1947 his family gave up their bush farm and moved to Coaldale, Alberta, a town east of Lethbridge peopled largely by Ukrainians, Mennonites, Mormons, and Central Europeans, as well as Japanese, who ended up there during WW II.<br><br>Rudy Wiebe read as much as possible from an early age; his first reading materials were the Bible, the Eaton's catalogue and the <i>Free Press Weekly Prairie Farmer</i>; he also recalls listening to his parents&#8217; stories of Russia. By Grade 4, he had read through the two shelves of books available in the one-room schoolhouse. Growing up, he enjoyed <b>Les Miserables, Toilers of the Sea, David Copperfield, Tom Brown's Schooldays</b>, Greek myths and Norse legends. Later an admirer of Faulkner, M&#225;rquez, Borges and Tolstoy, Wiebe has always held to the fundamentals of plot, character and, above all, story. He believes stories should begin in the specific and local but expand into &#8220;a human truth larger than any individual.&#8221;<br><br>Wiebe won his first prize for fiction while studying literature at the University of Alberta, where he enrolled in a writing class and began producing poems, plays and stories. His winning story in a Canada-wide contest recounted a young boy&#8217;s response to the death of his sister &#8211; based on Wiebe&#8217;s own experience &#8211; and was published in the magazine <i>Liberty</i> in 1956. After earning his B.A., Wiebe left for the ancient University of T&#252;bingen in West Germany on a Rotary Fellowship to study literature and theology, an experience that increased his respect for older and richer communities. Tena Isaak of British Columbia joined him there and they were married. The couple travelled in England, Austria, Switzerland and Italy before returning to Edmonton, where Wiebe completed his M.A. in creative writing. His thesis grew into his first novel, <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b>. <br><br>In 1962 Wiebe earned a Bachelor of Theology degree from the Mennonite Brethren Bible College; he considered becoming a minister. He was editor of Winnipeg&#8217;s <i>Mennonite Brethren Herald</i> when <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b><i> </i>was published. Many conservative ministers and Mennonites in small towns objected to the novel's frank and at times unflattering portrait of community life, and there was considerable opposition to the book. &#8220;I wasn't exactly sacked as editor . . . but the committee came to me and said &#8216;Ahem.&#8217; I resigned.&#8221; The strength of this reaction made him think hard about the power of the written word, and reinforced his sense of wanting to be a writer.<br><br>Wiebe then was invited to teach at a Mennonite college in Goshen, an agricultural town in Indiana with a large Mennonite and Amish population, where he would be Assistant Professor of English from 1963 to 1967. Goshen College was a lively and stimulating intellectual community where Wiebe committed himself to writing, study, teaching and travel. &#8220;I encountered men and women of real perception . . . really literate Christians who saw themselves as Jesus's followers and at the same time were acquainted with the thoughts of others and had brought that kind of understanding to bear on what it means to be a Christian. The best thing that ever happened to me was the meetings we had every two or three weeks in one home or another &#8211; seven or eight of us, a psychiatrist, a couple of theologians, a couple of literary people. There were the best theologians there, I think, the Mennonite Church has ever had.&#8221; <br><br>Wiebe published his second novel, <b>First and Vital Candle</b>, and began to explore the western United States and the Mennonite settlements in Paraguay. He returned to Edmonton as a professor in creative writing and English at the University of Alberta, and immersed himself in Canadian literature. He wrote reviews, essays and articles, edited anthologies and was soon established as a major figure in Canadian letters. In 1973, his novel <b>The Temptations of Big Bear</b> won a Governor General's Award. Since then he has continued to win the highest praise for his books of fiction and non-fiction. He has written numerous film and television scripts, lectured internationally from Denmark to India, and given readings from Adelaide to Puerto Rico to Helsinki and Igloolik. For thirty years he taught literature and creative writing at colleges and universities in Canada, the United States and Germany. Now retired from teaching, his former students include such accomplished writers as Myrna Kostash, Aritha van Herk, Thomas Wharton and Katherine Govier.<br>  <br>Wiebe was called the first major Mennonite writer to place his community&#8217;s experience in a broader framework. Mennonites assert the fundamental authority of Scripture, especially the New Testament, as a practical guide to life. But while Wiebe imbues his work with a deep moral seriousness, his focus has always been on narrative. &#8220;I never consciously think of writing a so-called Christian novel. I don&#8217;t think Albert Camus ever thought of writing an existentialist novel, either. I think of getting at, of building, a story.&#8221; As a prairie writer, he has often concerned himself with Native stories, feeling place of birth to be more important than blood ancestry. &#8220;Those Mennonite villages in Russia are my heritage, but not my world. The world I feel and sense in my bones is the bush of northern Saskatchewan, of prairie Canada.&#8221; Native spirituality, with its vital links to the physical world, has always attracted him. But his fiction manages to transcend nationality and locale to explore the struggles of communities and individuals; his books and stories have been translated into nine European languages, as well as Chinese, Japanese and Hindi.<br><br>Whatever Wiebe&#8217;s focus in a given work, he has always chosen ambitious themes, and his work rewards readers with an intensity seldom rivalled. He is a voice of Canadian fiction that cannot be ignored, and whose work promises to endure.",,,

I had finished a middle-grade novel, <i>The World&#8217;s Most Disgusting Sandwich</i>, and was trying to get it published.<br>&#8220;It has potential,&#8221; a potential agent told me. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to see other books you&#8217;ve written.&#8221;<br>Other books I&#8217;d written? I hadn&#8217;t written any other books. I had written an anonymous poetry column for a teachers&#8217; newsletter. I had written a bunch of essays in college and graduate school. I had written some irreverent songs to play on my guitar. &#8220;This is my first book,&#8221; I confessed. <br>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t typically represent books, we represent writers. Are you working on something else?&#8221;<br>I had started on a sequel and began to tell her about it.<br>&#8220;I mean something different,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to see what else you can do.&#8221;<br>Oh, crap. &#8220;I have a few other ideas,&#8221; I said. <br>She told me when I had something written she&#8217;d be happy to take a look.<br>So I came up with a new idea in a hurry and started writing the fictional memoir of Zeke Zagger, the world&#8217;s greatest super villain that nobody had ever heard of. It was supposed to be funny; instead it was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful. Reading over the first 20 pages, I began to worry about the state of my subconscious. <br><br>So I decided to try again with a new character, and the first thing I wanted to do was give him a name. Shakespeare. Shakespeare Shapiro. Wow, I thought, imagine being that kid. So I did imagine it, and I started to vent on paper. It turned out Shakespeare Shapiro had a lot to say, not just about his name, but also about his crazy parents, his maddeningly popular younger brother, his social ineptitude, and the overall catastrophe of his life. Much of what he said was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful; but it was also really funny to me. And I guess it was funny to other people, too, because <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is set to hit the bookstores on September 25, 2007.<br><br>As an eighth-grade teacher, it is both incredibly exciting and a little bit nerve wracking to have written a book that I know my students&#8211;and probably their parents&#8211;will read. I&#8217;m excited to become a minor celebrity for the first time in my life, at least within the walls of Manhattan&#8217;s Middle School 255. I&#8217;m excited that my students will see me as a real live writer, and I will be thrilled if more of them are inspired to carry on independent writing lives. But I wonder how they and their parents will react to the fact that the book deals so openly with the kinds of things teenage boys think about. Just imagine parent-teacher conferences, if you will: <br> <br><b>PARENT #1</b>: So, Jake, we read your book.<br><br><b>ME</b> (<i>smiling nervously)</i>: Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you how Becky is doing in class. Her writing is&#8211;<br><br><b>PARENT #2 </b><i>(holding up a copy)</i>: Masturbation. Drug use. Pornography. You seem quite well versed in these subjects . . .<br><br>You get the idea. So to the question of how much of <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is autobiographical, let me just say that nothing has ever been proven.

I am, and always have been, from the &ldquo;Only Boring People Are Bored&rdquo; school of thought, and worked hard as a child to develop and use my imagination. One of my favorite experiences from that time of my life is when I decided I had a future in Hollywood. <br>&#160;<br>It practically kills me to admit this, but I got the idea from a made-for-TV movie on &ldquo;The Wonderful World of Disney,&rdquo; a Sunday evening staple in our home in Andover, Ohio.&#160; Johnny Whitacre, who was my age, starred in <i>The Mystery of Dracula&rsquo;s Castle, </i>in which his character makes a movie.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929). After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley&nbsp;</i>(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&rsquo;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly.
