16,Marthe,Jocelyn,False,True,"When I was a child, I liked to read books about ordinary children who stumbled across enchantment. I really thought that if I looked hard enough, I might find a magic nickel or a secret room behind the bookcase or a gnarled gnome whom only I could see. As I grew older, I felt the same thrill of seeing mysteries unveiled when I went to the theatre or read a book. In my childhood activities, I played with dolls way past the normal age, made dioramas out of junk scraps, directed backyard plays with casts of neighborhood kids, and was always, always reading&ndash;only as an adult can I clearly see my pursuit of illusion.<br>When I was 14, I spent a year in a Quaker boarding school in England, encountering a world utterly different from my own, no magic necessary. I learned the advantage of being a stranger; I created a new character for myself, far from my family and not dependent on anyone&rsquo;s preconceptions. This later fed my approach to fiction: My heroines are small part &ldquo;me&rdquo; and large part invention of who I&rsquo;d like to be, or to have been. <br>My earliest chapter books (the Invisible trilogy) were about an ordinary child who stumbles across enchantment. My next several books were historical novels (<i>Earthly Astonishments, Mable Riley, </i>and<i> How It Happened in Peach Hill</i>), set in worlds utterly different from my own. It&rsquo;s easy to see in retrospect that exploring alternate realities began as a game in childhood and eventually became a consuming pastime, otherwise known as research. I <i>love</i> doing research. I depend on what I learn not only for flavor and accuracy of details, but also for the occasional serendipitous discovery that alters the plot of a story.<br>But then we come to my most recent novel, <i>Would You</i>. It is a complete departure from any of my other stories, because its inception was in the accident that gravely injured my sister when I was 20 years old and she was 27. Paula was hit by a car and remained comatose for several weeks. When she emerged, she was severely brain-damaged and a paraplegic. Ten years later, she was again hit by a car&ndash;in her wheelchair&ndash;and killed. <br>Friends were concerned that <i>Would You</i> would be too difficult to write. In fact, it was the easiest book I&rsquo;ve tackled yet. I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about plot! The characters are teenagers and the main challenge was to capture their irreverence and humor alongside the tragedy.<br>The friendship between the sisters, Natalie and Claire, is inspired by that of my own two daughters. As a mother, I delight in the love they have for each other. It is impossible not to think about my own sister and what I have lost. But here I am, 30 years later, having a fine life, and surrounded with the alternate reality that only teenagers can provide. I hope that I have written an elegy for my sister and an homage to my children.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/14548

39,Nancy,Osa,False,True,"<i>&#8220;We write from where we have been to where we wish we could be.&#8221;&#8212;Nancy Osa<br></i><br>Nancy Osa is the winner of the Delacorte Press Prize for a First Young Adult Novel for <i>Cuba 15</i>.<br><br><b><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><br>Write what you don&#8217;t know . . .<br></b><br>Don&#8217;t you love reading about your hometown in a book or seeing it in a movie? I sure do. It makes you feel a part of something important. Reciprocally, it&#8217;s fun to learn intimate details about other settings, other lands, or other worlds through fiction. I&#8217;m not sure which is best. In writing <i>Cuba 15</i>, my novel about a Cuban American girl interested in her past, I was able to savor the thrill of hometown recognition and the intrigue of a far-off place, and pass them on to readers. These elements hold a special meaning for young people who want to write. <br><br>Beginning writers are always told to &#8220;write what you know.&#8221; The question is, with limited years behind you, what do you know well enough to write about? Without fail, everyone has a beginning. You might start there. What&#8217;s your early history, in twenty words or less? I was born in Chicago, and my family moved to the south suburbs when I was five years old. Though I didn&#8217;t set out to write a book about the area, Chicago and the suburbs are part of the foundation for <i>Cuba 15</i>.<br><br>See? You probably know enough about yourself to begin writing a fictional setting. But I think that a good story entails writing<i> beyond</i> what one knows. I like to use realistic details, such as setting, as a jumping off point and then go on to explore mysteries or what-ifs. Though my father is from Cuba, I grew up in a very &#8220;American&#8221; household, so in writing <i>Cuba 15</i> I first had to admit how much I <i>didn&#8217;t</i> know about Cuba and my family history. As I learned, a book began to take shape. I considered what it would be like to grow up <i>with</i> that information. And my main character, Violet Paz, was born.<br><br>Although the research and writing process was long and complex, I was fascinated to see where my knowledge and ignorance collided or overlapped. Things that used to seem so black and white were suddenly every shade in between. The realization that I was the culmination of three selves&#8212;American, Cuban, and Cuban American&#8212;gave me wings. And as Violet came to this same realization on the page, I stopped struggling so much with my own identity.<br><br>Writing about others is a great way to learn, because the questions just keep coming, begging for answers. Considering some questions, however, requires special bravery. Setting this book in and around my hometown helped to bring my fears of the unknown&#8212;my Cuban roots, the current relationship between the U.S. and Cuba&#8212;down to earth, to make them smaller. And so I was able to address the question of Cuban American identity. The 61,500-word response became <i>Cuba 15</i>, and it all started because I wondered about where I came from.<br><br>In the novel, Violet notes that her father already knows where he belongs on the family tree: &#8220;The rest of us have to find out for ourselves what being Cuban is about.&#8221; If I could, I&#8217;d tell Violet that, while knowledge may be power, ignorance is the greatest teacher.<br><br>Maybe she should write a book.<br><br><i>Nancy Osa learned to write novels, break rules, and appreciate the absurd while at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.

Readers&#8211;and aspiring writers&#8211;are often curious about what inspires a story and from where authors get their ideas. How did <i>Cuba 15 </i>originate? Did you draw from experiences with your own family and adolescence? <br>A.</b> Like Violet, I had to actively learn about my Cuban side. While my American Cuban family may have eaten turkey and <i>frijoles negros </i>on Thanksgiving, we were more &#8220;apple pie&#8221; than &#8220;flan.&#8221;<i> </i>When I started researching Cuban culture in order to write a novel, I was thunderstruck to find that I had never heard of the <i>quincea&#241;ero</i> tradition. I never celebrated Sweet Sixteen, either. Not exactly a social superstar, I wondered how I would have reacted if I had been faced with a <i>quince </i>party to plan. That&#8217;s where Violet came in. I think she handled it all fabulously. That&#8217;s where we differ&#8211;she&#8217;s stronger, and funnier, than I am. But I gave her a lot of help. Yes, there are some reflections of my family in the Pazes . . . although I never met my Cuban grandparents.<br><br><b>Q. Violet experiences a lot of anxiety regarding her role in the <i>quincea&#241;ero </i>and her performances for speech class. Do you ever experience writer&#8217;s anxiety, or moments of doubt regarding your work?<br>A.</b> A writer&#8217;s life is so filled with doubt and risk on the business side that it leaves no room for creative doubt. The phrase &#8220;finding one&#8217;s voice&#8221; means that a writer gains the knowledge needed to arrive at a style that works for her. All she can do is write with all the honesty and trust she can muster. Obviously, it&#8217;s not a scientific process, so of course I make many false starts. But, whether a work is published or not, everything I write becomes part of my pool of creative resources, to which I can return at any time. When I am unsure of which direction to go with a story, I use my time-tested remedy: Think about it. <i>Then </i>write. I also find that discussing work in progress is vital. Early readers keep a writer honest and on track. Belonging to a fantastic writers&#8217; group keeps me down to earth <i>and </i>propels me to higher heights than I could ever scale alone. And it feels great when I can make them laugh.<br><b><br>Q. On that note, do you ever get up onstage and perform as Violet does? <br>A.</b> Hmm. I wrote, directed, and starred in my first play when I was in third grade. In grade school classes and Girl Scouts, I reigned as the queen of skits. Puppet shows, horse shows, piano recitals . . . yep, I guess I am and always have been a performer. I enjoyed mild success in Original Comedy and Reader&#8217;s Theater on my high school speech team, and now I enjoy performing slices of <i>Cuba 15</i> for readers at book events, complete with all the voices, drama, and humor involved. When I write, it&#8217;s like performing for myself, inside my mind. Though sometimes I find myself laughing or crying out loud!<br><br><b>Q. Violet has keen comic perception. Where do you get your sense of humor? Ever think of becoming a stand-up comic?<br>A.</b> Cubans have a unique sense of humor, and some of it seems to have flared up in me. I use humor in my writing because it puts the reader at ease and makes learning&#8211;a wonderful side effect of reading&#8211;more fun. I have always loved stand-up comedy; George Carlin and Steve Martin are my idols. But there wasn&#8217;t much of a comedy scene for women until I had already become interested in writing fiction. Some of my comic chops were cut in a college playwriting class; my professor passed on a good instinct for slapstick. <i>Pa-dum-pum!</i><br><br><b>Q. How did you become interested in the politics and history of Cuba? How can the average kid become informed and involved in foreign policy issues like this? <br>A.</b> I have family in Cuba whom I have never met, and this is a direct effect of U.S. foreign policy. When I began corresponding with my Cuban relatives as an adult, I faced many legal and cultural hurdles. Suddenly I needed to know why ordinary citizens&#8211;family members&#8211;in both countries were still being kept apart. As an American born between the 1959 Cuban revolution and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis (which posed a direct threat to the United States), I had only a hazy notion of the bad blood between the two countries. When I tried to send pens and paper to my cousins in Cuba, to ensure that they could answer my letters, I was refused. The postal clerk told me small packages were not allowed, and told me to &#8220;say hi to Castro.&#8221; Dealing with postal regulations and ignorant remarks brought the whole international affair down to a personal level. <br>In learning more about the longstanding embargo that restricts trade and travel between the U.S. and Cuba, I was impressed by the efforts of IFCO/Pastors for Peace. This organization [IFCO stands for Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization] has been challenging the embargo and promoting cultural exchange and peace with Cuba since 1992. Local Cuba groups across the country work with Pastors for Peace to change the laws and circumstances that divide rather than unite neighbors and families. Kids fit right in with such humanitarian efforts. They&#8217;re in the process of discovering their places in society and are natural bridge builders. But the simple act of learning more about a &#8220;forbidden&#8221; culture is a first step in reconciliation.<br><br><b>Q. Se&#241;ora Flora asks Violet &#8220;How do you see yourself?&#8221; Violet defines herself by what she is and what she isn&#8217;t. How would you define yourself in these terms? Do you have any &#8220;half talents&#8221; you&#8217;re still growing?<br>A.</b> How do I see myself? Well, first of all, I&#8217;m not the <i>quince</i> type. I don&#8217;t wear dresses or high heels&#8211;you&#8217;re more apt to find me in jodhpurs and boots. I would generally rather be alone at my desk or on horseback than onstage in front of an audience. But I am at home in a lot of environments. I like to get lost in the crowd on a downtown city street as well as lost in thought in the woods. I&#8217;ll also strike up a conversation with just about anyone, to share a little bit of life or get a fresh insight. &#8220;Half talents&#8221; are my specialty, and they make for lifelong learning: That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m glad my Spanish, my horseback riding, and my cooking can really use some work! As a writer, my half talent is exploring human nature, for I can never truly comprehend all its subtleties. But I can keep trying.<br><br><b>Q. Abuela asserts that it is women who carry tradition forward and see that it lives on. Do you agree with her? If so, why do you think this role often falls to women? <br>A.</b> I was thinking about food and holiday events, which are most often women&#8217;s domain. Even though my mother is not Cuban, she learned to cook my father&#8217;s favorite Cuban dishes. So when I was growing up, a lot of Cuban culture was served up in the form of <i>congr&#237;s, arroz con pollo, </i>and<i> lechon asado.</i> Visiting a cousin&#8217;s house in Miami one year, I encountered the Cuban tradition of eating twelve grapes at midnight on New Year&#8217;s. Most of my Cuban traditions came to me through food, as part of a gustatory collective unconscious. Who makes the Thanksgiving turkey or Christmas ham in your house? Who plans the get-togethers? Maybe Dad, but in years past the women stayed home and made these tasks part of their day, while the men went out and earned a living for their families. So perpetuating tradition through food and family gatherings was what women did. Nowadays, this type of traditional learning is probably fading away. Who spends two days marinating and slow-cooking a roast when they can microwave a fajita? (Answer: the author.)<br><b><br>Q. Do you recall an experience or a moment of realization in your young life that made you feel you had grown up? <br>A.</b> No. I didn&#8217;t have an <i>aha! </i>realization until I was thirty-seven, and, you know, that was right for me. Coming-of-age ceremonies were probably begun as a practical means of keeping young girls from becoming mothers too early. While the focus was on honoring the girl, the event may also have been a social tool for restraint aimed at men, in much the same way that other social taboos work. Violet&#8217;s <i>quincea&#241;ero </i>is not grounded in this tradition but does embrace the goal of moving a young woman toward her next phase in life. For Violet, all that process really takes is some thought and action: considering who she&#8217;d like to be, and then trying to effect that. Some people can do that at fifteen. It took me a while longer.<br><br><b>Q. Are you good at dominoes? What are the highest stakes you&#8217;ve ever played for?<br>A.</b> When it comes to poker, backgammon, and dominoes, luck is my friend, strategy a stranger. The highest stakes I&#8217;ve ever played for? My good image and ten cents. I probably lost on both counts.<br><br><b>Q. What would be the theme of your <i>quincea&#241;ero</i>? What would you include in the ceremony to make it reflect your personality (or just for fun)?<br>A.</b> My theme would be &#8220;Let the Good Times Roll.&#8221; I would enjoy blending all the elements of my roots&#8211;there would be Cuban music, Chicago blues, and food from both ends of that spectrum. Instead of a planned agenda, guests would encounter roving entertainers&#8211;an improv troupe, fire jugglers, Latin dancers&#8211;and have fun with a giant maze, an arts-and-crafts station, and a go-cart track. And, of course, before the cake was cut, there would probably be some sort of a performance by the <i>quince</i>-babe herself . . . dressed in her jodhpurs and boots.<br><br><br><br><b>PRAISE</b><br><b><br></b>CUBA 15<b><br><br></b>&#8212;Winner of the Delacorte Press Prize for a First Young Adult Novel<br><br>&#8220;I love the rambunctious, funny voice of this novel.

And so I thought, what if you did dwell upon it?&#160; What exactly would you see?&#160; <br><br>Months later I found myself on the winning end of a stack of history books about &ldquo;resurrection men&rdquo;&mdash;nineteenth-century grave robbers hired to steal bodies for use in medical school dissections.&#160; You might expect I&rsquo;d be disgusted at their adventures; instead, I found myself greatly impressed.&#160; There was an art to it.&#160; And like all arts, it was something that could be passed down, master to apprentice, or&mdash;even more interesting to me as an author&mdash;father to son.<br><br><u>THE CHALLENGE<br></u><br><i>Rotters</i> is a story about a boy named Joey Crouch who loses everything&mdash;his mother, his friends, his home, even his one talent is rendered useless&mdash;and then out of desperation turns to Ken Harnett, his mysterious and threatening biological father, only to find that Harnett is, in fact, the dad he&rsquo;s always needed.&#160; And this truth is in spite of&mdash;or maybe partly because of&mdash;what he does in graveyards under the cover of night.<br><br>I knew right away the biggest challenge in writing the book would be to generate sympathy for people who did something so repugnant.&#160; But I also knew right away that sympathy was possible, because the passing on of treasured information is by its very nature a tender act.&#160; Even Harnett&rsquo;s initial coldness is a form of tenderness: it&rsquo;s meant to turn Joey away from a dangerous and lonely life.&#160; When Joey is finally let in, he suffers a training period as cruel as that of any budding concert pianist, but what drives this merciless routine is, once again, love.&#160; The secrets Harnett reveal to Joey are no less than the secrets of mortality and how we deal with the promise of our own demise.&#160; It&rsquo;s heavy stuff, no doubt.&#160; But if handled with a little style and a lot of guts, I knew it could be the stuff of great literature, too.<br>&#160;<br><u>THE DARKNESS<br></u><br>We&rsquo;ve all seen those time-lapse films of the decomposition of a dead animal.&#160; At first, it&rsquo;s gross.&#160; But then the flesh&rsquo;s constant reinvention becomes fascinating, and, after a while, even sort of beautiful.&#160; It is my hope that Rotters has a similar effect&mdash;that if we, writer and reader, look hard enough together at something ugly, it might just transform into something magnificent.<br><br>Even before joining his father in the family business, the complications in Joey&rsquo;s life are legion: he&rsquo;s an outcast and his dad is the town pariah&mdash;not to mention that awful smell.&#160; But these burdens are nothing when compared to those of the men Joey meets: the underworld of grave robbers known as the Diggers.&#160; These Diggers are proud knights fighting for a dying kingdom and have given their entire lives to a labor no one will ever appreciate.&#160; Joey&rsquo;s arrival and his relationship with Harnett forces the Diggers to wonder if they&rsquo;ve wasted their lives.&#160; Surely no lurker of graveyards deserves a gift as great as love.&#160; This is a world of darkness that Joey has plunged into&mdash;and we haven&rsquo;t even gotten to Harnett&rsquo;s would-be brother Boggs, whose jealousy runs so deep that he&rsquo;ll stop at almost nothing to make Joey his own son.<br><br>Darkness is a defining characteristic of <i>Rotters</i>.&#160; But it&rsquo;s worthy to remember that darkness is just that&mdash;it&rsquo;s dark&mdash;and what is being concealed in the dark is not just the horrible and fearsome, it&rsquo;s also the inspirational and moving.&#160; Horror means nothing without happiness; dark means nothing without light.&#160; <i>Rotters</i> may make you feel scared, but hopefully it will also make you simply feel.&#160; It&rsquo;s that kind of book, or at least I hope it is.<br>&#160;<br>- Daniel Kraus",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/89150

61,Emily,Franklin,False,True,"Ten not-so-random facts about me:<br><br>1) Most of my memories have music attached to them. People and places and food all come with their own soundtracks in my mind. Sometimes when I write I can hear an unwritten piece of music playing, but most of the time, I choose songs and mixes/playlists that fit what I&#8217;m doing. Say &#8220;Ricki Don&#8217;t Lose that Number&#8221; and I&#8217;m back in Maine, wading into cold ocean water and wondering if I should go to graduate school. &#8220;Sledgehammer&#8221; and I&#8217;m kissing a boy named Sam in the art room back in high school. &#8220;Roam&#8221; and I&#8217;m 17, driving with my best friend, Jules, debating the seemingly endless possibilities for our evening&#8217;s entertainment. Music features in my books because it has always held an important place in my life.<br><br>2) I love to sing cheesy songs while my husband plays the piano. This might be one reason I married him&#8211;anyone who can deal with me belting out Air Supply&#8217;s greatest hits is okay in my book. <br><br>3) I can write anywhere. Give me a laptop, a piece of paper, a pen, a typewriter, or a stick and some wet beach sand and I&#8217;m good to go. I&#8217;ve never been one of those writers who needs to have all the stars aligned and the perfect time and spot to produce good stories. In fact, some of my best ideas come to me while driving.<br><br>4) Given a choice between vanilla and chocolate, I&#8217;ll choose black raspberry. Or coffee. Or mint chocolate chip. Part of being a writer for me is looking for options that aren&#8217;t offered&#8211;that is, beyond the chocolate/vanilla and into the sometimes-murky other flavors.<br><br>5) Cats love me. I do not love them. Sneeze. Hack. Cough. I am a dog person without a dog. I have four kids and that&#8217;s plenty right now.<br><br>6) I cannot paint like Jenny in <i>The Other Half of Me,</i> but I wish I could. Writing and cooking are the two most creative activities for me (and parenting, but that&#8217;s a little different). <br><br>7) My older brother once made me eat rocks (okay, pebbles, but they were from our driveway and mixed with candy that <i>looked</i> like rocks and I got confused).<br><br>8) My favorite time to write is in the early morning. By the time night comes around, I want to read, eat something yummy, watch whatever the Netflix god delivers, and go to bed.<br><br>9) Before I wrote novels, I wrote poetry. Before that, I wrote medical text and summaries of classic works of literature (think <i>The Odyssey</i>) in slang. Before that, I was a chef. Prior to that, an English teacher. Writing wins.<br><br>10) Getting lost in a book is the best way to travel.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/73618

92,Paula Young,Shelton,False,True,"I was born in New York City, during an explosive time in American history, the 1960s. One day, my parents were watching the news on TV and saw black and white students being beaten for riding the bus together. When my parents saw this they knew right away that it was time for them to go back to the South and fight for civil rights for all. I was not even a year old when we moved to Atlanta, Georgia.&#160;<br><br>What I remember most about growing up in Atlanta was that our house was always full of people. During the civil rights movement, there would be people sleeping on our floor, meeting in our living room, and eating at our table. Later, when my dad ran for Congress, it was more of the same. I always had many aunts and uncles that were not related to us at all, but part of our family, nevertheless.<br><br>I&#160;went to a private school for the first couple of years of my education, one that my oldest sister, Andrea, integrated. When she graduated, she recommended that Lisa and I leave, too. It had not been a pleasant experience for her and she wanted to spare us the pain. I continued in public schools until my dad became the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and we moved to New York again, where I finished high school at the United Nations School. Then, it was back to the South, to Duke University, for college. After that I headed to Uganda to try teaching. I loved it! I returned to New York one more time to get my master&rsquo;s degree in Education at Bank Street College.<br>&#160;<br>I started teaching in Atlanta public schools, and one summer I went to Washington, D.C., to work for the National Black Child Development Institute. I met the love of my life, Hilary Shelton, who impressed me with his passion for justice. I married him one year later. We have three amazing, creative, energetic sons&mdash;Caleb, Joshua, and Noah&mdash;who keep us very busy and quite entertained.&#160;<br><br>I always loved to write. I would write volumes of poetry, keep a diary, record my dreams, and write long letters, short stories, and even a television show. I wrote my first children&rsquo;s book as my master&rsquo;s thesis. My cousin illustrated it and I sent it out to countless publishers, and received countless rejections. I kept writing. My current work-in-progress features three amazing boys who bear a striking resemblance to my own sons.<br><br>As a first-grade teacher, I get to read a lot of children&rsquo;s books and I also enjoy storytelling. I began telling stories about the civil rights movement to our students, and one day a parent, who happened to be a published author, heard me and said, ""You should write this down."" Of course, I already had and he soon introduced me to his agent. And that&rsquo;s how I got to be a published author.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/79566
93,Susanna,Vance,False,True,"<i>Susanna Vance lives in the rainy Northwest, in a little yellow house on a hill above a river. Her short stories have appeared in many literary publications. Her writing is known for its dark humor, quirky characters, and strong voice.</i><br><br>Susanna Vance has been named a <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Flying Start Author and her novel <i>Sights</i> is an ALA Best Book for Young Adults. <i>Deep</i> has been nominated by the American Library Association as a Best Book for Young Adults 2004. <br><br><br><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</b><br><br>Dear Readers and Fellow Changelings,<br><br>My stories are about transformation. In them, fat people don&#8217;t necessarily transform into thin ones, nor do snaggle-toothed computer nerds become prom queens&#8212;although sometimes they do because we all love that kind of thing. What interests me most, though, is change within one&#8217;s self. <br><br><i>Dark</i>, <i>quirky</i>, and <i>magical</i> are words used to describe my work. I&#8217;m a fan of those things. You need dark to distinguish light, and magic to find the edges of science. Even very young children love to snuggle in their cozy, well-lit bedrooms and enter the dark, spooky forests of a fairy tale. We have a taste for the gothic, although none of us want to be trapped in grim situations ourselves. When that does happen, it&#8217;s the brave or hilarious or unpredictable way we deal with it that defines who we are. For example, in <i>Sights</i>, displaced Baby Girl finally gives up trying to fit in and devotes herself to playing the accordion with her odd little band. The things that set her apart from her peers go on to transform her, and she regains the feisty confidence she was born with. <br><br>I think we all start out optimistic and ready to rock and roll. Things happen that change that. A single traumatic incident with school, friends, or family can shrivel the innocent self-satisfaction of early childhood. In <i>Deep</i>, sad, powerful Morgan sails away from her broken family but remains enshrouded by the past: her past is a constant mist that blurs the way she sees the world. Freedom from that mist comes to her through a spirited little girl who opens Morgan to viewing herself, and her family, in a different way.<br><br>Such change is possible. As a child, I daydreamed my way through years of school.

After receiving her B. A. in English at the University of New Mexico, she enrolled in the University of New Mexico law school but completed only three semesters before deciding that writing and storytelling, not law, were the means by which she could best promote justice. She married John Silko in 1970.

Initially conceived as a comic story abut a mother&rsquo;s attempts to keep her son, a war veteran, away from alcohol, <i>Ceremony</i> gradually transformed into an intricate meditation on mental disturbance, despair, and the power of stories and traditional culture as the keys to self-awareness and, eventually, emotional healing. Having battled depression herself while composing her novel, Silko was later to call her book &ldquo;a ceremony for staying sane.&rdquo; Silko has followed the critical success of <i>Ceremony</i> with a series of other novels, including <i>Storyteller, Almanac for the Dead</i>, and <i>Gardens in the Dunes</i>. Nevertheless, it was the singular achievement of <i>Ceremony</i> that first secured her a place among the first rank of Native American novelists.

I think I must have thought that books were born on the library shelves. But I was good at writing stories, and I had a good deal of practice.<br><br>My primary school teacher came in every Monday morning in the worst of moods. 'Fetch my bag'. He'd lay his leather strap across the front of his desk as a threat or warning. Then he'd turn and chalk up three titles on the board: <i>A Day in the Life of a Lost Umbrella, My Best Friend, The Worst</i> <i>Advice I</i> <i>ever Took</i>; anything like that. Then: 'I want absolute silence till break-time' he'd say, nursing his hungover head. 'The first person to whisper gets the strap'.<br><br>I loved those double lessons more than anything in the world (except for reading). No endless discussions. No sharing of ideas. No realising that someone else had also had your brilliant idea. I covered reams of paper. I wrote fast. And I learned to judge the form and the length of a story. It was the best training I could ever have had, though I didn't know I'd be a writer.<br><br>I still work with a pencil and rubber in absolute silence. I still hide my work with my arms if anyone walks past, and I wouldn't dream of talking about what I'm writing or let a soul look at it until it's completely finished. Oh - and I still prefer reading other people's books to writing my own!<br><br>A lot of my work, even for fairly young readers, raises quite serious social issues. I believe that many personal decisions have a social or political resonance, and the way people try to pick their way through tricky family situations interests me. But people won't (and shouldn't) read books that don't hold their interest, and I still adore funny books. So since I write for the reader inside myself, I always end up with the kind of book I would have loved to read (if only someone else had bothered to write for me).",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/8678

When I was young, I regularly tested myself to see whether my incipient magical powers had arrived. For some reason I can't now remember, the test itself was always the same: I would close my eyes and attempt to conjure a tiny swimming pool (the ultimate wish for a city kid, perhaps).

I was a strange kid&ndash;or at least one who was open to the world's possibilities.<br><br>As I got older, I performed the swimming-pool test less and less often.

It was, for me, a terrible violation of privacy.<br><br>Like so many passionate readers, I decided to try to write a book of my own&ndash;to open one of those magical doors myself. It turned out to be very hard. The door did not spring open at my touch the way I'd secretly hoped it would. The knob was greasy and the frame had swelled in the heat. But as I struggled with it, I caught a few glimpses of what was on the other side&ndash;snow, and dogs, and people flying by on ice skates. And those images kept me from giving up.<br><br>The wonderful thing about writing fiction is that you can be inspired by the real world without being limited by its facts. You are allowed to imagine and embellish (particularly when one of your main characters inhabits an invented world of ice). I decided that my story took place in Greenland, where dog sledding is part of everyday life, and suddenly I had a cast of dogs. I discovered that a glacier could conceal a freshwater lake. I read about fireflies and learned that their&#160;light is&#160;triggered by oxygen. A glaciologist told me how to scare a polar bear with a flare gun, and why he loved his bread maker. And then I made a few things up.<br><br>With help from several people, I got that first door open. Now I'm standing in front of another one.

Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: ""I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!""

I have to write books which at least have the potential to effect changes . . .&quot;</i>--L. S. Matthews<b><i><br><br></i></b>L. S. Matthews is the winner of the Fidler Award for her book<i> Fish</i>, an award given for a first novel for children. She lives and writes in England.<b><i><br></i><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><i><br>How I write:<br></i></b>When I wrote <i>Fish</i>, it was based on a dream I had. I woke up and thought (as you would, if you had a dream like &#8220;Fish&#8221;), what was all <i>that</i> about? I thought about it, and it seemed to start making a kind of sense. I think I had to put the events in order, as parts of the story appeared in flashback sequence in the dream. I am not sure, but I think I continued to dream other parts of the story later.<br><br>There is no sensible time, as an adult with responsibilities, to sit about writing stories, but I wrote <i>Fish</i> at a particularly silly time. I had two children, knew I had to sell my house, but had no idea where we were going to live, or how we could afford it - I had just walked away from three terms of strenuous teacher training.<br><br>With all these pressures on me, I watched news footage of determined and courageous refugees on television, and went off to bed, worrying about, of <i>all </i>things, how I would transport the three Koi Carp from our pond without distressing them, and to where?<br><br>All my writing seems to happen like this - it works from dreams; in the daytime, I correct and alter and move it around in my head till it seems to make sense; I don&#8217;t write anything down; and by the time I come to write, I know it pretty well and have got rid of all the worst mistakes. Because it&#8217;s hard to keep a whole book in your head and keep running through it to make sure you don&#8217;t forget, I&#8217;m very keen to get it down. I touch type (I was forced to learn how in my first job) so, having worked on a book in my head for maybe six months, I can have the first draft out in two to four weeks, because I am just typing out a story I have already written. I like to do this outside as much as possible, otherwise I get miserable from being inside too much. With <i>Fish</i>, I typed for 12 hours a day sometimes, in this very brief period; I calmed down a little with my second book. <br><br>I like to work like this because when it&#8217;s in your head it is easy to just rip out a chapter or move something to a different part of the story - no retyping time and time again!<br>When I was a child and had scary dreams, I learned to manipulate them, to control the events. I think this plays a part in the way my dreams form the stories to my books.<br><br><b><i>Where do you get your ideas for characters, settings, events? </i><br></b>All of my characters have different parts of my personality in them, I suppose, and parts of people I have known.<br><br>Events - well, I have never battled through a war-torn zone, but I came across a body when I was ten or so, and therefore I could write about Tiger&#8217;s feelings, sitting by the body of the young man who was shot.<br><br>I grew up the youngest of a family of five children; both of our parents worked full time and the house had a long garden which backed onto a wild area of land . . . much of my time was spent scrambling about, making camps, coming home filthy and scratched, but happy. I had two older brothers and singularly failed to notice that girls should be different until people started telling me so at about the age of 12. I had already noticed something was up when I was sent to our local school at 7, and didn&#8217;t get to play cricket and football like at home, but was pushed into a collection of people who played netball and rounders . . . hence the issue - or lack of it! - of Tiger&#8217;s gender in Fish. Some people still don&#8217;t get it. They say, &#8220;I thought it was a girl/boy&#8221; and then ask, &#8220;Well, which was it then? What was Tiger supposed to be?&#8221;<br><br>I answer: &#8220;Tiger&#8217;s not <i>supposed </i>to be anything.&#8221;<br><br>Then they say, &#8220;Yes, but what did you write it as? Girl or boy?&#8221; Just as they are sure there is an answer, I am equally fascinated by the fact they think it matters.<br><br><b><i>Animals (including fish and  birds) are important in my books because:<br></i></b>They may appear in the story at a moment which makes them symbolic, but they&#8217;re real too.<br><br>I communicated with animals probably before I could walk or talk; they were just different kinds of &#8220;peoples&#8221; to me then. I am more likely to notice a small bird hidden in a hedge than a human passing in full view and I still find it hard sometimes to concentrate on a human conversation when an animal is talking at the same time.<br><br><b><i>What motivates me to write?<br></i></b>It gets things out of my system, things that I am cross about, and maybe I can&#8217;t put everything right, but I can say to the world, &#8220;What about this? This is not good enough.&#8221; And to readers who may not have been fully aware: &#8220;This is reality, I know you&#8217;d rather think it has nothing to do with you.&#8221; But at the same time I can show the inspirational qualities of people . . . I am angry at what they are put through, but their courage and determination is something to admire, and only tends to be shown when tested to the limit. It puts my own worries, and my own abilities to cope, in proportion. I wouldn&#8217;t write a book which didn&#8217;t challenge the reader with questions which maybe aren&#8217;t easily answered. I have to write books which at least have the <i>potential</i> to effect changes . . .",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/58241

Before writing books, she worked for many years as a UPI correspondent in Asia, with stints in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.<br><br><br><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><br></b>I come from a literal family. Everybody says just what they mean, with few embellishments, regardless of who likes it, or whether it makes sense.<br><br>&#8220;How do you suppose that we ever ended up with a writer in this family?&#8221; my mother asks.<br><br>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; I reply. &#8220;Anyway, I may be something else next year.&#8221; But it makes me wonder what exactly my family has had to do with my being a writer. Here are some things I remember about growing up among them.<br><br>My father and brother are engineers&#8212;they can tell you how anything works. When my brother won the Jermyn (Pennsylvania) Soap Box Derby race on the hill outside our house on Franklin Street, I was sure our family had reached its pinnacle of fame.<br><br>My mother, who acts and speaks without pretense or subtlety, is matter-of-factly brave and has an intuitive mind. You didn&#8217;t dare contemplate doing anything you weren&#8217;t supposed to do when she was around. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you even think about it,&#8221; she&#8217;d say. When I was twelve, Charlie Fron, our school bus driver, told me she was a good mother, and that she could make a whole busload of kids behave by just looking at them. I stood there a moment, breathing in the silage smell of the bus (Charlie kept it in his barn when the weather was cold) and thought my heart would burst with pride.<br><br>My father&#8217;s mother, Mema Fisher, was gentle and lovely&#8212;she knew about color and texture and mood. Her eye was always cocked for a shapely flower, even if it was a weed; her ear was always tuned to the sounds of the woods. She had a chaotic garden that was always in bloom, and I loved going to her sitting room to listen to our favorite songs (which included &#8220;Mockingbird Hill&#8221;) on her record player.<br><br>Mema Brittain, my other grandmother, and my aunt Elaine were compassionate women. They were capable of understanding and forgiving almost everything. Unlike the rest of my tall, large-boned family, they were delicate and feminine. I was a flower girl at Aunt Elaine&#8217;s wedding, and I treasured the weeks of preparation, during which the two of them introduced me to the mysteries of face creams and perfume and silk slips.<br><br>I found out much later why it was that my mother had absolutely nothing (except love) in common with the two of them&#8212;but that&#8217;s another story.<br><br>When I was small, I would float in the bathtub made especially for my very long father and create scenes in my head in which I would be a diva or a famous actress.<br><br>I lived to fish. In the summer, I got up before dawn and climbed into my bathing suit, shorts, and T-shirt. I&#8217;d spend every day on the dock in front of our summerhouse on Chapman Lake with a line in the water, daydreaming about all the exotic places I&#8217;d ever heard of, stopping only when it got hot to jump into the icy water. At night we&#8217;d go out with flashlights to pounce on nightcrawlers for the next day&#8217;s fishing. My sister Karen thought my activities were unspeakable. She and her friends met to paint their nails. (<i>Another </i>story, perhaps.)<br><br>I was a liberal arts major in college, mainly because I couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation to read to my heart&#8217;s content and get credit for it. After graduation I had various jobs, all having something to do with writing and research. Eventually I landed in Hong Kong, where I became a reporter for United Press International. For six years I alternated between being a desk rat and covering the China story, meeting scholars, artists, lawyers, and businessmen who had been inside China, which until 1978 had been closed to Americans for a quarter of a century. I played tennis overlooking the harbor, sailed on the South China Sea, ate Suchow food in the back alleys of the Western District, and sometimes talked until dawn in hotel bars with triad gang members, Chinese Communists, and other questionable characters who would have made my mother&#8217;s hair stand on end. (Yet another story!)<br><br>When UPI offered me my own bureau in South Asia, my mother said, &#8220;Come home. Quit this Mata Hari life and meet a nice man, get married, and have some children.&#8221; But I had friends who were living sensible lives, and they hadn&#8217;t necessarily ended up with love, marriage, and houses full of happy children. So I went to India.<br><br>It&#8217;s been said that revolutions happen in ten-year cycles. In 1989, it was the extraordinary events of Eastern Europe. In 1979, the year I went to India, the revolution in Iran resulted in the taking of American hostages. Here are some of the things that happened that year in the countries my UPI bureau covered: In Pakistan, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged. Islamic fundamentalists burned the American Embassy in Islamabad with ninety people inside. Most of them survived, but six people died. In India, Indira Gandhi presided over the demise of the government of Morarji Desai and returned to power, beginning a period of more violence than at any time since the aftermath of the independence of India and Pakistan from British rule in 1947. Civil war broke out in Afghanistan, two prime ministers were killed in office, and Soviet troops entered the country, to remain for ten bloody years.<br><br>Keeping up with these events resulted in the most adventurous phase of my life to date. I traveled extensively with Mrs. Gandhi as she campaigned. We talked early in the morning over tea and late at night over warm milk. I shot the first photographs of Soviet troops being airlifted into Kabul. In the ranks of soldiers marching across the tarmac at the Kabul airport, one carried a Christmas tree on his shoulders. Fear was as thick as dust in the air. Our Afghan colleagues and friends began to disappear.<br><br>Three years followed in Washington, during which I worked on a part-time basis for <i>The Washington Post</i> and began to write fiction. I returned to Pakistan in 1985 to work under contract to the U.S. Agency for International Development on a study of poor rural women. It was during this time I met an extraordinary girl in the Cholistan Desert, the daughter of a nomadic camel herder, whose story became the basis for <i>Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind</i> and <i>Haveli</i>.<br><br>If there is anything special at all about us odd ducks who write, it is our passion for stories. I used to worry that I&#8217;d run out of stories, but so far I haven&#8217;t. If I ever do, I plan to take up fishing again.<br><br><br><b>PRAISE<br><br></b>HAVELI<br><br>&#8212;A <i>Booklist </i>Editors&#8217; Choice<br>&#8212;An ALA Best Book for Young Adults<br><br>&#8220;Again, Staples imbues Shabanu and her beautiful, repressive world with a splendid reality that transcends the words on the page.&#8221;&#8212;Starred, <i>Kirkus Reviews<br><br></i>&#8220;As freshly inspired as its predecessor.&#8221;&#8212;<i>The Bulletin<br><br></i>&#8220;Page-turning intrigue.&#8221;&#8212;Starred, <i>Booklist<br><br><br></i>SHABANU<br><br>&#8212;A Newbery Honor Winner<br>&#8212;An ALA Notable Children&#8217;s Book<br>&#8212;An ALA Best Book for Young Adults<br>&#8212;A Library of Congress Children&#8217;s Book of the Year<br>&#8212;An IBBY Honor List Book<br>&#8212;A <i>Horn Book</i> Fanfare<br>&#8212;A <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book of the Year<br>&#8212;A Notable Children&#8217;s Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies<br><br>&#8220;One of the most exciting YA books to appear recently. . . .

224,Jerry,Stanley,False,True,"<i>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned there&#8217;s no such thing as wasted writing or bad writing. All writing leads to better writing.&#8221;&#8212;Jerry Stanley<br><br></i>Jerry Stanley is the author of several highly praised books for young readers, including <i>Children of the Dust Bowl</i>, winner of the Orbis Pictus Award; <i>I Am an American,</i> an ALA Notable Book; and <i>Hurry Freedom</i>, a National Book Award nominee and winner of the Orbis Pictus Award. He is a former professor of history at California State University.<br><br><br><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><br></b>Being a writer is one of the great achievements of my life. As a teenager growing up in Detroit, Michigan, I hated school, all my teachers, and learning in general. When I was expelled from high school at the age of seventeen for fighting, I had passed two units&#8212;one in woodshop and one in gym. In bidding me farewell, my counselor fired his last shot at my self&#8217;-esteem: &#8220;Stanley,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re so dumb you couldn&#8217;t finish school even if you tried.&#8221;<br><br>It has taken a lot to prove him wrong. I joined the Air Force to get away from home and after a few years started taking correspondence courses through the mail. During the day I drove bulldozers and forklifts, and at night I learned how to write a complete sentence. I was twenty-one when I finally received my diploma from high school, which was somewhere near the base but which I never saw or visited. I was playing drums in a rock-&#8217;n&#8217;-roll band when I left the service and enrolled in junior college. This was the turning point in my life: not what I learned there, but getting the nerve to enroll.<br><br>I was the model insecure student, as hardly a day passed without my remembering, &#8220;Stanley, you&#8217;re so dumb. . . .&#8221; I can look back now with amusement and laughter at some of the things I did. For example, when I was registering on the first day, standing in a long line to get past this one station, a woman asked, &#8220;What do you think your major will be?&#8221; I had no idea of what she meant by &#8220;major,&#8221; but the girl in front of me said &#8220;English&#8221; and that got her through, so I said &#8220;English&#8221; (whatever that was) too. A month or so later, while talking about the upcoming midterm (my first), the teacher said, &#8220;Blue books are required. You can&#8217;t take the midterm without a blue book.&#8221; I spent nearly an hour in the library looking for the blue books&#8212;in the card catalog under blue, in the periodicals&#8212;until a kind reference librarian told me, without snickering, that they were in the bookstore. Though amusing now, when these things happened to me, they were proof that I would be found out: <i>I don&#8217;t belong here.<br><br></i>Fearing failure, I became an overachiever. I overstudied every subject, and wrote and rewrote each term paper before finally relinquishing it. But I still lived in doubt from one grade report to the next. Making the dean&#8217;s list, graduating from junior college with honors, and being invited to join an honor society all gave me tremendous confidence&#8212;for about a day, before the old demon of self-defeat reemerged. Nevertheless, I made my second big decision and enrolled in a state university. At least I now knew what a major was, and I proclaimed &#8220;History,&#8221; but the most enduring memory of my first few weeks there was learning how to spell <i>university</i> (in case I suddenly had to).<br><br>When it became clear that I would get my bachelor&#8217;s degree cum laude, I vowed to continue my education until they kicked me out or until there were no other degrees to earn, whichever came first. This was the easiest decision because it came last and not because I had unshakable confidence in my ability to do graduate work. Looking back, I now see that I was not ready for school when my counselor committed that great crime against me by calling me stupid. The hardest decision was the first time I tried to prove him wrong by enrolling in junior college and showing up for my first class quite literally trembling in my chair.<br><br>Before the university said that&#8217;s it, I earned a Ph.D. and a Phi Beta Kappa key and was lucky to secure a teaching position at a university where I was forced to think about becoming a writer to keep my job. I wrote scholarly articles and book reviews and delivered papers at professional conferences, which led to promotion as full Professor of History with tenure. Only then did I start thinking about becoming a writer in the sense of communicating with a wide audience by using language that could be understood. I would be lying, however, if I said I know why I became a writer. My best guess is that I became a writer because I had to&#8212;I&#8217;m not happy unless I&#8217;m writing something.<br><br>I started writing magazine articles, which gave me the experience I needed to write books. I wrote fishing articles, human interest stories, and accounts of things that had happened to me that were unusual or amusing. For instance, while attending college, I lived above a funeral parlor for three years; I wrote about my humorous&#8212;and chilling&#8212;experiences there in <i>Nightlife in the House of the Dead: Notes from the Second Floor.</i> I had a heart attack and an out-of-body experience and wrote about that also. All of this gave me experience in writing for different audiences. I did not sell everything I wrote, but that was okay, because I&#8217;ve learned there&#8217;s no such thing as wasted writing or bad writing. All writing leads to better writing.<br><br>Because I&#8217;m a historian, nonfiction writing has always been more interesting to me than fiction; and because of my background, I&#8217;m drawn to topics where people overcome adversity and empower themselves. <i>Children of the Dust Bowl</i> is a good example of this; I can identify with the Okie children who were kicked out of school because they were considered too dumb to learn but who, nevertheless, built their own school, got an education, and went on to succeed with their lives. Similarly, <i>I Am an American</i> is about a group of people who suffered injustice and still struggled against the inequity of ignorance and of prejudice.<br><br>The time that I have to write is determined by my teaching schedule, except in the summer, when I divide my days between fishing and writing. I teach courses in California history, the American West, and Native Americans and California Indians, usually three days a week, leaving three days open for writing and Sundays for racquetball, the family, and chores. I need at least four hours to do any serious writing, and other things must be in place: a Xerox photo of my subject affixed to the wall, where I can readily see it, the research notes for the day arranged in neat order, and a copy of my last book resting on the pages of my new book. Before I write, I have to read the last few pages I&#8217;ve written&#8212;to prove I <i>can</i> do it because I have done it.<br><br>If in four hours I can write two to five pages that can say exactly what I want to say, I&#8217;m happy. But beyond that, I&#8217;m not sure what it takes to be a writer. For me, good writing requires good thinking, and good thinking requires good reading, plus research. The other thing I suspect about writing is that probably anyone can do it if they work at it long enough and hard enough.

227,Jake,Wizner,False,True,"It was 2003. I had finished a middle-grade novel, <i>The World&#8217;s Most Disgusting Sandwich</i>, and was trying to get it published.<br>&#8220;It has potential,&#8221; a potential agent told me. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to see other books you&#8217;ve written.&#8221;<br>Other books I&#8217;d written? I hadn&#8217;t written any other books. I had written an anonymous poetry column for a teachers&#8217; newsletter. I had written a bunch of essays in college and graduate school. I had written some irreverent songs to play on my guitar. &#8220;This is my first book,&#8221; I confessed. <br>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t typically represent books, we represent writers. Are you working on something else?&#8221;<br>I had started on a sequel and began to tell her about it.<br>&#8220;I mean something different,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to see what else you can do.&#8221;<br>Oh, crap. &#8220;I have a few other ideas,&#8221; I said. <br>She told me when I had something written she&#8217;d be happy to take a look.<br>So I came up with a new idea in a hurry and started writing the fictional memoir of Zeke Zagger, the world&#8217;s greatest super villain that nobody had ever heard of. It was supposed to be funny; instead it was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful. Reading over the first 20 pages, I began to worry about the state of my subconscious. <br><br>So I decided to try again with a new character, and the first thing I wanted to do was give him a name. Shakespeare. Shakespeare Shapiro. Wow, I thought, imagine being that kid. So I did imagine it, and I started to vent on paper. It turned out Shakespeare Shapiro had a lot to say, not just about his name, but also about his crazy parents, his maddeningly popular younger brother, his social ineptitude, and the overall catastrophe of his life. Much of what he said was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful; but it was also really funny to me. And I guess it was funny to other people, too, because <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is set to hit the bookstores on September 25, 2007.<br><br>As an eighth-grade teacher, it is both incredibly exciting and a little bit nerve wracking to have written a book that I know my students&#8211;and probably their parents&#8211;will read.

I&#8217;m excited that my students will see me as a real live writer, and I will be thrilled if more of them are inspired to carry on independent writing lives.

245,Jen,Bryant,False,True,"<b><i>1. You&#8217;ve written on a wide variety of topics. Where do you get your ideas?<br></i></b><br>Honestly, ideas are everywhere: in books I read, in people I talk to, in my own household and neighborhood. The challenge is to capture them and mold them into a story that will both entertain and inform my readers. I don&#8217;t have a standard method of choosing which ideas I will turn into books . . . it&#8217;s more like the ideas choose me! For example, my first novel, <i>The Trial</i>, began as I was writing a series of poems (which I intended to send to magazines) about the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and murder case. Before I knew it, I had put everything else aside and was really delving into the facts and myths about the investigation and the trial. A brief visit back to my hometown of Flemington, New Jersey, where the 1935 trial took place, convinced me that I should try and tell the whole story in a verse novel.<br><br><b><i>2. You wrote more than a dozen biographies before turning to fiction. How did that experience affect your later writings?<br></i></b><br>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with real events and real people&#8211;and I find them frequently more interesting and more bizarre than anything I could ever make up. I also love to research&#8211;and by that I mean I love to hunt for interesting and little-known facts. The research process is never boring! I travel to museums, archives, and small towns where significant events took place (such as the Scopes Monkey trial in Dayton, Tennessee); I go to plays and watch movies; I interview famous people and witnesses to history; I read historical documents, books, magazines, and web pages. <br><br>3. <b><i>Your third novel, Pieces of Georgia, is a 13-year old girl&#8217;s journal about her dead mother, her still-grieving father, her athletic best friend, and her own desire to become an artist. How did you create this character&#8211;and why did you have her live on a horse farm?<br></i></b><br>Many aspect of my own life came crashing together in that book. When I was a teenager, I spent many Saturdays on a horse farm in central New Jersey, and I used those memories to create the setting for <i>Pieces of Georgia.</i> I also grew up next to a funeral home (my father and grandfather were undertakers), so I had a lot of opportunity to observe how grief and loss affect different people. I participated in three sports in high school, but still had a lot of free time to explore other interests. Now, however, sports have become year-round and hyper-competitive and so I created Georgia&#8217;s friend Tiffany to represent the difficulties that teens today must deal with if they&#8217;re into sports. Lastly, I didn&#8217;t go to school for writing, so I had to engage in a lot of trial-and-error to find my own style and voice. In <i>Pieces of Georgia</i>, that&#8217;s exactly how Georgia goes about learning how to draw. <br><br> 4. <b><i>Tell us about your recent novel</i></b> <b><i>Kaleidoscope Eyes.</i></b><br><br>The main plot involves three friends who stumble onto a set of maps they suspect may lead them to one of the buried treasures of the notorious pirate Captain Kidd. (I started this book long before the recent events involving modern pirates starting appearing in the news!) The story takes place in 1968, in a small town in southern New Jersey. The entire &#8216;60s decade was turbulent, but that year was especially so: we had the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the peak of the Vietnam War, and hundreds of antiwar protests and sit-ins. There were huge rock concerts and drug use was rampant. Civil rights and women&#8217;s rights were gaining momentum, but there remained many parts of society who were violently opposed to both. So&#8211;in a way, it&#8217;s a 17th-century pirate tale embedded in a 1960&#8217;s rock &#8217;n&#8217; roll era story. It was a lot of fun to research, and hopefully even more fun to read!<br><br><br><b><i>OTHER FAQs:</i></b><br><br><b><i>Where were you born?<br></i></b><br>Easton, Pennsylvania . . . but I only lived there for a few weeks.

I had no intention of recycling somebody else&rsquo;s creation; I wanted a monster of my own.&#160; Tucked away in our bunk beds, my brother Steve and I whispered creepy-creature names at each other in the dark until we hit the jackpot: The Seaweed Strangler.&#160; We lived on Pymatuning Lake, which has more than its share of seaweed and swampy locations, and now that I had a main character and a setting, I was on my way.&#160; <br>&#160;<br>Okay, so <i>The Seaweed Strangler</i> didn&rsquo;t win any awards, and I didn&rsquo;t go on to become the next Steven Spielberg (who also started out with an 8-mm camera, by the way).&#160; The truth is that the movie is still a work in progress.&#160; I continue to blame the film editing machine that broke down in mid-edit thirty-plus years ago, but now that I&rsquo;ve had the film transferred to DVD, I&rsquo;m running out of excuses not to finish it.&#160;&#160; (All of which really irritates Steve, who still hasn&rsquo;t forgiven me for the two weeks he spent walking barefoot through the muck and mire while draped in seaweed!) <br>&#160;&#160; <br>Last summer, though, I found a way to revive the Seaweed Strangler -- to bring the creature, and my movie, back to life.&#160; I started work on a novel about a boy who discovers his father&rsquo;s partially finished movie -- titled, you guessed it, <i>The Seaweed Strangler</i> - and decides to add a few scenes of his own.&#160; No, I don&rsquo;t have a son in real life, but that&rsquo;s the best part about being a writer: I get to make stuff up, and use my imagination to let my characters do all the things I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>, or <i>hope</i> to, or don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to, or would <i>never</i>, do.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/77752

317,Amber,Kizer,False,True,"Have you ever played a game called Three Truths? Basically, it&#8217;s like a multiple choice test except you have four choices and one of them is a total lie&#8211;the others are true&#8230;The point of the game is to figure out which one is a total lie . . . what&#8217;s that? You wish you could play right now? Well, goody because I think that&#8217;s much more fun than a dry bio&#8211;plus you could win big prizes (that&#8217;s a lie), but you&#8217;ll have the invigorating experience of being right. And really when it comes down to it, how can a new car beat being right? <br><br>We&#8217;ll start off easy to get you warmed up. First set: 1) Amber Kizer is my real name; 2) I live on an island; 3) I have a rooster named Fabio; 4) I have parakeets named Chirp and Pecker<br><br>Think you know which one is false? Say it out loud, no cheating! Ready? I do not have a penname, which means Amber Kizer is, in fact, my real name (although, I have considered writing under the name J.K. Rowling, just because it has such a catchy ring to it). I do live on an island. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not a gorgeous tropical island. It&#8217;s in the Pacific Northwest where gray skies and green trees (thanks to the rain!) are the most popular colors. I do have a rooster named Fabio. He is named after a very famous cover model for romance novels&#8211;the human Fabio is beefy, doesn&#8217;t own t-shirts, and has long blond hair he swings around seductively. The chicken Fabio isn&#8217;t beefy (tastes like chicken), doesn&#8217;t own t-shirts, and has long blond feathers, which he does indeed throw around like he&#8217;s in front of a wind machine. I do not have parakeets because I don&#8217;t like cages and in my mind having parakeets is one step away from wearing housecoats, lycra in public, and owning 50 cats, all named Sweetie. <br><br>It&#8217;s going to get harder . . . 1) I make wedding cakes for fun; 2) I love reality TV&#8211;especially dating shows; 3) I have four kids and am married; 4) I don&#8217;t miss a minute of March Madness basketball if I can help it.<br><br>Think you know? I do make wedding cakes for fun, and birthday cakes, and I love you cakes, and cakes of all kinds. I love to bake. If you want to see photos of cakes I&#8217;ve made just visit my Web site at AmberKizer.com. I do love reality TV&#8211;and especially dating shows, the raunchier it is, the funnier and the better it is. Please don&#8217;t hold this against me, I&#8217;m in therapy to break the addiction! I adore college hoops and try not to miss any of the tournaments&#8211;men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s. I&#8217;m not married and don&#8217;t have kids&#8211;I&#8217;m young and, while I do hope those things are in my future somewhere way down the line, they&#8217;re on the wish list rather than in the cart. I am, however, in stock and ready to ship. <br><br>All right, I&#8217;m done being nice to you. Here&#8217;s a hard one: 1) I read 15&#8212;20 books concurrently; 2) I quilt; 3) Roses are my favorite flower; 4) I collect amber jewelry when I travel.<br><br>I do read a huge, high stack of books all at the same time&#8211;it keeps it interesting. There&#8217;s too much to learn in the world to read one from start to finish. So I read a chapter, change books, read a chapter and so on, until whatever I&#8217;m reading is so compelling I have to finish the book. Pretty much any topic is game, but I stay away from math theory and computer programming because they just give me a headache. I do quilt&#8211;I love working with colors and fabrics. I don&#8217;t quilt as often as I&#8217;d like because these hands are usually wrung dry from typing, but yum, it feeds my creative soul to stitch fabrics together. Roses are a favorite, but my ultimate favorite flowers are lilies&#8211;Casablanca white ones, Stargazer pinks, any of the really fragrant lilies&#8211;the scent makes my soul smile. So that was kinda a trick one because, of course, I collect amber jewelry. I love it and it looks good with my coloring, so it&#8217;s a win win. <br><br>Now, to the super-duper difficult ones: 1) I&#8217;ve wanted to be a writer since I could talk; 2) I wrote my first book at the age of five called &#8220;Wiggle Me, Tiggle Me&#8221;; 3) I only write when my muse taps me on the shoulder; 4) I don&#8217;t have to do much editing; it&#8217;s usually close to perfect the first time around.<br><br>Think you know? Ha ha, changed it up&#8211;they&#8217;re all LIES! LIES, LIES, LIES! Okay, so maybe that wasn&#8217;t fair, but it was fun. I always wanted to be a criminal prosecuting attorney and eventually a Supreme Court Justice. (Can you spell <i>overachiever</i> anyone?) But I played basketball fervently, and over the course of high school, I ended up with some fairly nasty injuries to my feet and legs. Those led to surgeries, which then gave room to a rare nerve disorder. I developed symptoms at age 18 and it totally and completely sucks (just telling it like it is). In the simplest of terms, the system that controls pain signals, temperature, circulation, and all that very important stuff is corrupted to the point that it&#8217;s wrong all the time&#8211;which means my legs hurt all the time and don&#8217;t always work for me when I ask them to. So this means my life has to be fairly fluid&#8211;I can not tell you how many plans I&#8217;ve had to cancel, how many shows I&#8217;ve given away tickets to, how many great ideas I&#8217;ve had to say &#8220;sorry&#8221; to. I know someone loves me when I say I&#8217;m hurting and they show up with ice cream and a video when we were supposed to go out. This also means that I can&#8217;t count on my legs to have a structured 9 to 5 job (although I&#8217;d love to do any number of things on a consistent basis), so I had to figure out a career that was flexible and that I could do on the good days, or from a horizontal position on the bad ones. A friend invited me to a workshop she was giving on how to teach writing to kids. I did all the activities, and I was hooked on storytelling. I came away from that six weeks with six pages of a story. I wanted to know the ending, so I kept writing. <br><br>Oh, and I should probably tell you that I started in adult romances. Yes, that&#8217;s right, I <i>love</i> romances and they&#8217;re completely a hoot to write&#8211;a hopeless romantic, I adore happy endings and who doesn&#8217;t like hot, steamy, monkey s---socks. Monkey socks.  So I wrote one book, then another, then another. The whole time I was learning what I could about the craft&#8211;it&#8217;s like wanting to be a great artist you need to know the techniques and tools of the craft, and you have to practice. I also spent a great deal of time learning the business end of things&#8211;how agents work, how publishing works, what to expect, what to do right, and what to avoid doing at all costs. There&#8217;s so much to learn I&#8217;m convinced I will never know it all. But I worked my way up the scale from form letter rejections to handwritten notes to long, involved letters asking for revisions. <br><br>I was working on my fourth romance when a voice in my head started giving editorial input. &#8220;He put his hand where? That so wouldn&#8217;t happen . . . eeewww.&#8221; And on and on. Meet Gert. She had things to say and I desperately needed her to shut up, so I opened a new word document and went at it. I figured I&#8217;d let her go until she ran out of steam and then I could get back to the real writing. I guessed 20 pages tops before she ran out of things to say. That was 2005 and she&#8217;s still going. Nothing is off limits, she talks about everything&#8211;even the stuff parents hope their kids don&#8217;t know about. <i>One Butt Cheek</i> is the first in her series&#8211;the second <i>From Butt to Booty</i> comes out next fall.<br><br>I always edit. I always rewrite. And there are no such things as <i>muses</i> unless you use that as a synonym for <i>discipline</i> or <i>perseverance</i>. <br><br>My advice for anyone who thinks they want to be a writer is to hang glide. No, again that&#8217;s not the truth, but it sounds way more interesting than the truth, which is to . . . um . . . write. Also get good at surviving rejection because you have to. Because you have to put yourself out there all the time and learn how to shake it off and do it all over again the next day. You won&#8217;t get published if you don&#8217;t send it out. And you won&#8217;t get published if you send out crap that you haven&#8217;t perfected to the best of your ability. But it&#8217;s not easy, it&#8217;s not pain free and it&#8217;s not for the weak of spirit. It&#8217;s hard, competitive, and everyone thinks because they type out e-mails that writing a book can&#8217;t be much harder than that. Oh yeah, everyone thinks they could write the next bestseller without breaking a sweat, everyone thinks they&#8217;re a writer&#8211;just know that up front. <br><br>So here&#8217;s my advice&#8211;it&#8217;s really good practice to ask the cute boy out, call the girl who you&#8217;ve been crushing on since sixth grade, make yourself available and vulnerable. Because here&#8217;s the deal, they might say yes, they might have been enamored of you for ages, too. Because you could get the call that says, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a contract offer on your book!&#8221; Or at the very least you&#8217;ll have some soul-wrenching real-life experience to write about and that, my friends, is the truth and nothing but the truth. So help me Gert.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/73191

349,Carol,Weston,False,True,"Hey! I&#8217;m so glad that you clicked onto this page! <br><br>I&#8217;m Carol Weston and I could tell you where I was born and where I went to school, but you can find all that out at carolweston.com. What I really want to tell you is that I love writing Melanie Martin books&#8211;and I hope you love reading them.<br><br>Melanie is smart and funny and gets embarrassed easily. She likes doodling and making up little poems. She keeps a diary everywhere she goes. She also worries a lot; she can&#8217;t help it. Melanie lives in New York City with her art teacher mom, history buff dad, and little brother Matt the Brat. The Martin family (or the four M&#8217;s: Melanie, Matt, Miranda and Marc) love to travel. Melanie has different crushes, but just one best friend, Cecily. She also has a new enemy, Susan. Mel calls her Suze the Ooze because she&#8217;s always saying, &quot;No offense but&#8230;&quot; and then saying mean awful terrible things. It drives Mel crazy! Melanie&#8217;s stuffed animal is a hedgehog, Hedgie, who is cute cute cute but sometimes gets lost.<br><br>In every book, Melanie goes someplace different. Melanie is ten when the family goes to Italy and Holland, and eleven when she discovers Spain and Manhattan. If you read her diaries, here&#8217;s what you get: <br>1. A sneak peek at a girl&#8217;s most private personal thoughts (this can be fascinating stuff whether you&#8217;re a girl or a boy) and<br>2. A tour of every site that Melanie visits (from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, to Anne Frank&#8217;s house, to a bullring, to the Empire State Building).<br> <br>When I write these books, I do my best to make them funny and suspenseful. Thanks to Matt the Brat, every diary is also loaded with silly jokes. Like: &quot;Where do hamsters go on vacation?&quot; &quot;Hamsterdam!&quot; I try to share cool facts about different countries and cultures too. When the family goes to art museums, for instance, the mom tells stories about Vermeer or van Gogh. (But, shhhh, Melanie and Matt always play their favorite museum game: Point Out the Naked People!)<br><br>You can also learn foreign languages with Melanie. Spanish is espa&#241;ol which she spells out as S Pon Yole. But watch out. Once Melanie wanted to tell a boy she was embarrassed, so she said she was embarazada and, uh oh, that meant she was pregnant! And that was really embarrassing!!! <br><br>You can read the books in any order, but here&#8217;s how I wrote them:<br><br>The Diary of Melanie Martin (they go to Italy)<br>Melanie Martin Goes Dutch (they go to the Netherlands)<br>With Love from Spain, Melanie Martin (they go to Spain)<br>Melanie in Manhattan (they stay home and Melanie finds out that it&#8217;s harder than you think to like two boys at one time!)<br><br>The diaries are about family, friendship, and first love, and they can all double as travel guides. I promise you&#8217;ll like them! If you want to write me, my email is at carolweston.com. And you know what? I&#8217;ll write you back!<br><br>Ciao for now--<br><br>Carol Weston <br><br>P.S. If you still want answers, I grew up in Armonk, New York; I live in Manhattan with my husband, two daughters, and cat; I studied French and Spanish literature at Yale; I earned an M.A. from Middlebury; I&#8217;m the &quot;Dear Carol&quot; advice columnist of Girls&#8217; Life; my books for older kids include Girltalk, For Girls Only, and For Teens Only; and I love visiting schools!

In <i>Before I Die,</i> the protagonist is dying, but the novel is actually an examination of what it means to be alive. In <i>You Against Me</i>, there has been an allegation of sexual assault, but at the book&rsquo;s heart is a love story. <br>&#160;<br><b>What inspired you to write <i>You Against Me</i>?</b><br>I actually knew very little when I started writing. I had a few ideas, but they were abstract, theoretical, as if I knew the tone of the piece, but nothing else. I always use free writing techniques when I start a new book, which is a bit like improvising in theatre&mdash;throwing words down and not planning anything in advance. Most of it goes in the bin, but the strongest themes and voices keep returning. <br>&#160;<br>After months of this, I began to know more. I was haunted by a small seaside town, by a girl called Karyn who alleged something terrible had happened to her and by her brother, Mikey, who was out for revenge.<br>&#160;<br><b>Your new novel handles a very tough topic that effects many teens. What was that responsibility like and how did it inform your writing?</b><br>I often felt overwhelmed with responsibility. I didn&rsquo;t want any girl or young woman to pick&#160;up my book and think after reading it that they shouldn&rsquo;t&#160;bother reporting an assault, and yet I wanted the novel to accurately reflect the very difficult realities of&#160;prosecuting a case such as this.<br>&#160;<br>I tried not to let my fear inform the writing. The danger was that I would hold back on tackling anything too difficult in case I offended anyone. To counter the fear, I interviewed criminal lawyers, social workers, family support workers and police officers. I watched court cases and read lots of books. The research really grounded the novel, but it slowed me down a lot too. When the first draft was finished, every single one of the people who helped me with research read it and gave feedback. I wanted any gender bias or prejudice to come from the characters, not from the author. I wanted to be sure I wasn&rsquo;t perpetuating any myths or stereotypes around sexual assault.<br>&#160;<br><b>Were there any other young adult works that you found particularly helpful or inspirational while working on <i>You Against Me</i>?</b><br>I tend to steer away from fiction that is thematically similar when I am writing. I stick to nonfiction books about the subject instead. <br><br><b>The two main characters of <i>You Against Me</i> are not directly involved in the incident that the book centers around. Did you know from the beginning that you would tell the story from the perspectives of Mikey and Ellie, the siblings of the victim and the accused?</b><br>I originally started writing from Karyn&rsquo;s point of view, but it became clear quite quickly that her perspective was too &ldquo;hot.&rdquo; In fact, she was a very unreliable narrator, often unwilling and mostly silent, almost as if she didn&rsquo;t want to be in the story. At that point, her brother Mikey took over the narrative. In fact he ran with it. He was determined to avenge his sister and all I had to do was follow him.<br>&#160;<br>I loved writing Mikey because he was a mass of contradictions&mdash;he&rsquo;d left school with limited prospects, yet was hugely ambitious. The main carer for his family, he also managed to juggle a complicated love life. Bright, but often inarticulate, he had an innate distrust of authority, yet his family were dependent on police and social workers for support.<br>&#160;<br>I thought I&rsquo;d found the book&rsquo;s narrative voice, but then Ellie appeared&mdash;clever, determined Ellie. She&rsquo;d recently moved to the area and had no friends yet. She did, however, have a brother and she certainly seemed to know a lot more than she was saying about what had happened to Mikey&rsquo;s sister. <br>&#160;<br>With two voices, a more complex narrative began to emerge. I also knew that being one step back from what happened was a more interesting way to tackle the subject of assault and all the prejudice that surrounds it. <br>&#160;<br><b>While dealing with sexual assault, <i>You Against Me</i> is much more than an &ldquo;issues&rdquo; book. Was the theme of finding love in unexpected places something that evolved during the course of your writing?</b><br><i>You Against Me</i> is a love story, but the love is fought for under very difficult circumstances. It&rsquo;s also about truth, about looking at someone you know really well and wondering if you know them at all. Those two threads evolved quite quickly as I wrote. &#160;I don&rsquo;t want my job as a writer to be about looking at &ldquo;issues&rdquo; or giving moral guidance. Teens don&rsquo;t want to read about things adults think are good for them, or about how they <i>ought</i> to behave. <br>&#160;<br>Of course, books can address difficult situations and confront social issues and help readers deal with real-life challenges. They can transport you, make you think, move you . . . the list is endless. Ultimately though, it&rsquo;s the story&mdash;with all its complexities, with the emotional truths it uncovers, the experiences beyond the everyday that it gives, that will be the real reason why young people read.<br>&#160;<br><b>The Parkers and the McKenzies are from different social classes. What inspired you to have these families, and Mikey and Ellie, come from such varied worlds?</b><br>I know it sounds odd, but I have no clue about character, geography, social class, or anything else when I begin a novel. After months of generating material, I begin to get a clearer idea of what a book might be about. I guess I had Romeo and Juliet in the back of my mind because I was interested in loving someone forbidden. But I also had Hamlet in my mind&mdash;something rotten in your own family.<br>&#160;<br>It was important to me that my two central protagonists would never have met under normal circumstances. I wanted them to have to tackle their own prejudices about each others&rsquo; backgrounds, as well as their preconceptions about the assault. I wanted them to fall in love &ldquo;despite themselves.&rdquo;<br><i>&#160;</i><br><b>What do you hope that readers come away with after reading <i>You Against Me</i>?</b><br>I was attempting to write a good story, one that moved readers emotionally, but also made them think. I hope that the book encourages debate for the very reason that I am <i>not </i>telling anyone what the right answers are.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/79554

436,Kate,Klimo,False,True,"<b>Tales of a Fourth Grade Fantasy Writer<br></b>It all began in the fourth grade when my best friend, Justine and I--inspired by <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, <i>Curdie and the Princess</i>, <i>The Wonderful Journey to the Mushroom Planet</i>, the books of E. Nesbit (and countless other works of fantasy recommended to us by our imperious rouge-cheeked librarian, Mrs. Thackeray)--embarked upon a fantasy epic of our own. We wrote our epic in multi-colored inks (Justine had gotten this nifty set of colored plastic quills for her birthday) in a series of classic black and white composition notebooks, whose white spaces we colored in so that every time we touched them, we got rainbows on our fingertips. I can&#8217;t remember the plot but I do know that it featured a cast of unicorns, elves, fairies, and an evil magician whose name, Pezlar, was inspired by our favorite candy. Our characters lived on islands that were shaped in their own likenesses; for instance, the unicorns lived on an island shaped like a unicorn head, where there was, naturally, a Cape Horn and a Beard Bay. Whenever we had writer&#8217;s block, we simply drew maps. We were writing (and drawing), not so much for posterity as to conjure a world that, we fervently hoped, would one day open its magical portals and take us in. The world shimmered with latent magic and we lived our days in a state of heightened expectation. When would the magic reveal itself?<b><br><br>Those Magical Oldsters<br></b>Taking our cue from the Professor in the Narnia books, Mary Poppins, and Mrs. Pigglewiggle, old people were especially magical to us. Ike Raff, the grumpy old man who owned the cigar store; Charlie Hicks, the seven-foot-tall homeless man who marched in the Memorial Day parade in a full Cherokee regalia, and even the scary Mrs. Thackeray were, we suspected, distinguished emissaries from magical lands. To their credit, they played it straight when, with burning intensity, we asked them such questions as, &#8220;Where do you really come from?&#8221; and &#8220;How did you get here?&#8221; &#8220;Did you fly, teleport, or use a traveling spell?&#8221; <br><br><b>Step right up to the Museum of Magic<br></b>Magical talismans were vitally important to us. We collected beach glass, horse chestnuts, antique buttons, old coins, and even a green crystal doorknob. And, yes, we had our own Museum of Magic that we set up in Justine&#8217;s side yard, which was just across the street from the beach. I say we set it up. I&#8217;m not sure we ever had any paying customers. We were raising funds so that we could buy the fabric to make long hunter-green capes with hoods. These were the outfits we planned to wear when we passed through the magical portals.  We must have raised the funds somehow, because we actually stitched up the capes on my mother&#8217;s sewing machine. How proud we were of them! So you can imagine how crushed we were when we wore them into town one day and somebody asked us which 4-H troupe we belonged to. <br><br><b>Magical Portals<br></b>We looked everywhere for them: Mr. Raff&#8217;s cigar store (where we would later buy our Beatles fan mags), an old wooden boat house down at the beach, an abandoned rococo-baroque Victorian mansion near my house just bristling with magical possibilities.<br>One Friday night, before our favorite TV show, <i>Twilight Zone, </i>came on at 9:30, we took a candle and some matches and made a pilgrimage to the Victorian mansion. It was a cold and windy night, I recall, and when we spied a broken window off the porch, it seemed to say to us, &#8220;Trespass, please!&#8221; With lit candle, we solemnly walked from room to room, searching for the portal. When we got to the third floor landing, the candle suddenly flared up and then guttered. We screamed and tore out of that place back to my mother&#8217;s warm, safe kitchen. Magic, we concluded, was sometimes a pretty scary proposition. We steeled ourselves and determined to make a return trip to the ruined mansion. We never managed that second trip because a wrecker ball rolled in and leveled the site of our closest brush with magic. A branch of the U.S. Post Office took its place and, although we never attempted to break in (Federal Offense!), we did loiter in the foyer, searching for magical signs among the Wanted Posters and the public notices. <br><br><b>Adolescence Rears Its Ugly Head<br></b>Looking back on those years, I see that, for us, magic was a kind of pagan belief system. It was both an affirmation of and an escape from life. But maintaining our belief system was not always easy. It was often downright burdensome. We had our rituals to observe, and our obligations, too. (We held weekly classes for our stuffed animals in the faerie arts, complete with lesson plans and demonstration models). Our beliefs isolated us from the other kids (who already suspected we were more than a little bit tetched). There came a time when a kind of low-grade dread began to steal over us; dread of the day when, like Susan Pevense, we would wake up and want to wear lipstick and stockings. And of course, that day did dawn, slowly enough to be agonizing. It started with the Beatles. We simply redirected all that magical intensity in the direction of the Fab 4. Instead of believing in portals, we believed we would one day not only get to meet them, but get to marry them (Justine, John; me, Paul). After that, it was a just small step to wearing lipstick (well, Mary Quant lip gloss, in any case), stockings (fish net), mini skirts (tweed and veddy British) and, before we knew it, we were looking back on our days of magic with patronizing fondness. <br><br><b>Reader, I Wrote<br></b>When I grew up, I still wanted to write but writing for children seemed, well, childish. I determined to be a writer of Adult Books, and succeeded (on a very modest level). But what can I tell you? The lack of magic in the adult world, as much from a reader&#8217;s standpoint as a writer&#8217;s, eventually got to me. I missed the magic, and years later, here I am, drawn back to its portals. I even find myself believing again. I believe that the world in which we live, the world of consensus reality, is but one small room in a mansion full of rooms. I believe that writing and reading are two surefire ways to get access to the other rooms. And nowadays, it is my sole ambition to grow up to be one of those old people who just might be mistaken for a distinguished emissary from a magical land. <br>Do I fly, teleport, or cast traveling spells? <br>The answer to all of the above is yes!",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/15932

473,Jennifer Lynn,Barnes,False,True,"I&#8217;ve wanted to be a writer for pretty much as long as I can remember. In fact, aside from a brief flirtation with the idea of being a veterinarian when I was four, being a professional writer has been my ultimate dream job (and, for that matter, my ultimate dream) for more or less my entire life. Along with my dislike of chocolate (I know, I&#8217;m a freak) and my love of all things sparkly, my passion for fiction&#8211;books, television, movies, and more&#8211;has probably been one of my most enduring character traits, and one of the ones that has most defined me as a person.<br><br>The summer I was 19, I wrote <i>Golden</i>, the story of a girl named Lissy who moves cross-country and lands right smack dab in the middle of the world&#8217;s scariest and most intimidating high school social hierarchy. Like Lissy, I changed schools at the start of my high school career. Unlike Lissy, however, I had to find my place at my new school without the aid of any kind of supernatural power.<br><br>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with the supernatural. When I was little, I used to watch <i>Bewitched</i> on television and wonder why it didn&#8217;t work when I twitched my own nose. In the third grade, I read Roald Dahl&#8217;s <i>Matilda</i> and spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to move things with the power of my mind. I love mythology, fairy tales, ghost stories, and the idea that there might be more out there than any of us can logically explain.<br><br>When I sit down to write a book, I usually start out with a supernatural concept&#8211;like aura vision or the idea of mystical tattoos capable of giving their wearers super powers&#8211;and then I think about my own experiences in life and try to identify an aspect of teen experience that fits with that particular slice of the supernatural. In <i>Golden</i>, Lissy&#8217;s ability to see auras gives her insight into the behavior of others, so I chose to throw her into the world of high school cliques, where her power would be both a blessing and a curse. <br><br>All of my characters lead double lives as normal teens in the every day teen world that have to deal with some pretty fantastical things. In many ways, I relate. Not because I have powers of my own (sadly, if I do have any super powers, they are as yet unidentified), but because throughout college, I lived my own double life&#8211;as a novelist and a student. I loved Yale, and didn&#8217;t want to miss out on any of my four years there, so more often than not, I was a college student by day and a writer by night, doing most of my writing between two and four in the morning, after everyone else had gone to sleep.<br><br>I&#8217;m a big believer that a writer has to be, first and foremost, a person who is out there in the world, experiencing life, and that is exactly what I try to do.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/69151

I do that a lot as a writer&mdash;challenge myself to try new things&mdash;and tackling a fairy tale was <i>definitely</i> a new thing. So how to begin?&#160;<br><br>I knew I wanted my story to have a classical feel, incorporating such wonderfully delicious fairy-tale elements as four-and-twenty blackbirds, enchanted forests, and hairy trolls. On the other hand, I wanted it to be totally original, a story like no other. I began writing, and within a few weeks had a tale. But let me tell you a curious truth about writers&mdash;they <i>are</i> the stories they write, the fictions they spin. And when I read back what I had written, I realized I had created a fairy tale about . . . <i>me</i>. Weird, but true! The story is filled with my favorite things&mdash;journeys and birthdays and cake. The princess, taking after my son Scott, is allergic to strawberries. And Jack? Just like me, he good-naturedly follows life&rsquo;s road, gathering experiences he can spin into tales.<br><br>Spinning experiences into tales is what I did with <i>The Fabled Fifth Graders of Aesop Elementary School</i>, too.

And all the while I&rsquo;m doing these things, I&rsquo;m thinking about how I can use them in a book. Let me give you an example. A few years ago, I was visiting a school in Tennessee when a fifth-grade boy came up to me and said, &ldquo;Look what I can do.&rdquo; He stuck out his tongue, crossed his eyes and wiggled his ears &ndash; first the left one, and then the right one. I was impressed&mdash;but I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything yet! Within seconds, the rest of the fifth graders surround me. Everyone, it seemed, had some special body trick to show me&mdash;double-jointed fingers and toes, eyelids that folded, lips that could be pulled up over noses, knuckles that cracked to the tune of &ldquo;Yankee Doodle.&rdquo; It was absurd and wonderful, and I knew I had to write about it.

558,Emily,Franklin,False,False,"Ten not-so-random facts about me:<br><br>1) Most of my memories have music attached to them. People and places and food all come with their own soundtracks in my mind. Sometimes when I write I can hear an unwritten piece of music playing, but most of the time, I choose songs and mixes/playlists that fit what I&#8217;m doing. Say &#8220;Ricki Don&#8217;t Lose that Number&#8221; and I&#8217;m back in Maine, wading into cold ocean water and wondering if I should go to graduate school. &#8220;Sledgehammer&#8221; and I&#8217;m kissing a boy named Sam in the art room back in high school. &#8220;Roam&#8221; and I&#8217;m 17, driving with my best friend, Jules, debating the seemingly endless possibilities for our evening&#8217;s entertainment. Music features in my books because it has always held an important place in my life.<br><br>2) I love to sing cheesy songs while my husband plays the piano. This might be one reason I married him&#8211;anyone who can deal with me belting out Air Supply&#8217;s greatest hits is okay in my book. <br><br>3) I can write anywhere. Give me a laptop, a piece of paper, a pen, a typewriter, or a stick and some wet beach sand and I&#8217;m good to go. I&#8217;ve never been one of those writers who needs to have all the stars aligned and the perfect time and spot to produce good stories. In fact, some of my best ideas come to me while driving.<br><br>4) Given a choice between vanilla and chocolate, I&#8217;ll choose black raspberry. Or coffee. Or mint chocolate chip. Part of being a writer for me is looking for options that aren&#8217;t offered&#8211;that is, beyond the chocolate/vanilla and into the sometimes-murky other flavors.<br><br>5) Cats love me. I do not love them. Sneeze. Hack. Cough. I am a dog person without a dog. I have four kids and that&#8217;s plenty right now.<br><br>6) I cannot paint like Jenny in <i>The Other Half of Me,</i> but I wish I could. Writing and cooking are the two most creative activities for me (and parenting, but that&#8217;s a little different). <br><br>7) My older brother once made me eat rocks (okay, pebbles, but they were from our driveway and mixed with candy that <i>looked</i> like rocks and I got confused).<br><br>8) My favorite time to write is in the early morning. By the time night comes around, I want to read, eat something yummy, watch whatever the Netflix god delivers, and go to bed.<br><br>9) Before I wrote novels, I wrote poetry. Before that, I wrote medical text and summaries of classic works of literature (think <i>The Odyssey</i>) in slang. Before that, I was a chef. Prior to that, an English teacher.

Time passes as the reader turns the pages, revealing events in a sequence&#8212;a story. <br>My paintings have always been narratives, and the natural next step was books.<br><br><b>Ideas</b> <br>Ideas come from anywhere and everywhere. Because of this, everything I do has a chance of influencing my work. Experiences + reaction to those experiences = ideas. <br><br>My favorite part of the bookmaking process is the beginning: exploration, discovery, sketching, daydreaming. <br><br>I make many preliminary sketches. I need to get an idea down on paper so I can step away and literally see it. The novelist E. M.

My kitchen is never cleaner than when I&#8217;m in the middle of a project. <br><br>I&#8217;m generally lazy, but that&#8217;s overcome by the desire to see what comes next. My gadfly is curiosity. <br><br>At first, I have only an inkling of what I want a book to look like, and I&#8217;ll put those ideas down in pencil sketches or a rough dummy. This is a point of departure. What I imagine&#8212;the visuals in my head&#8212;are never as rich as the real thing, so I make something, and then either leave it, change it, or wipe it away and start over again. <br><br>I work slowly and I try to work on all the paintings, alternating from one to another each day (usually in no sensible pattern!).<br><br>I don&#8217;t think I create paintings as much as recognize them when I bump into them.<br><br>I use oil paints, which dry slowly and allow me to explore slowly. Oils also smell like painting&#8212;there is a sensory connection to history.<br><br>I visit museums and galleries as much as I can and I try to look at everything with an interested and curious eye. I always find something I never expected to be as wonderful as it is.<br><br>I wipe away about as much paint as I apply. It has to be a trial-and-error process.

627,Frank,Portman,False,False,"&#8220;Why did you decide to write a Young Adult Novel?&#8221; <br><br>That's usually the first question you get when someone learns you have written a book like King Dork. One way to respond is to say: &quot;I've only written the one book. But I've read&#8230; several.&quot; Said in the right way, it can be pretty funny. You pause, make your eyes go a bit wry, yet serious, and slightly emphasize the word &quot;several.&quot; See, &quot;several&quot; sounds like too few books to have read when you're going around saying you're an author. <i>But of course</i>, the questioner thinks, <i>he could be kidding. Couldn't he</i>? If things go according to plan, the next question will be: &quot;What is your favorite book you've ever read?&quot;  You can answer with a question of your own: &quot;you mean all the way through?&quot; Then look a bit stumped. With any luck, the original question will have been forgotten by then, and you can go back to whatever you were doing.<br><br>But I'm going to break with my usual policy here and be perfectly honest: the reason for trying to wriggle out of that question by acting like an idiot is that I don't know the answer. It's not like I &quot;decided&quot; to write a YA novel. The way it happened was, I had misspent pretty much my entire life writing songs for my punk rock band. I had a cult following. One former cult member became a literary agent when he grew up (they do that sometimes - grow up, I mean) and he had the idea that the sort of characters, themes, and turns of phrase that pop up in my songs of arrested adolescent angst might make a pretty good book. I was skeptical but I said I'd give it a shot. I procrastinated for a long, long time. Then one day I started typing and, somehow, through a process I neither understand nor even really remember all that well, the stuff I was typing turned into a novel about a teenager. And, <i>voil&#224;</i>, (if, <i>voil&#224;</i> is the right word), I became a YA novelist. Actually, <i>voil&#224;</i> is definitely not the right word, because it took almost two years in the end, and it was kind of hard. It was like watching grass grow while hitting your head against a rock.<br><br>To continue the unfamiliar technique of being perfectly honest, I'll admit something else: I have, in fact, read a lot more than several YA novels. Like many kids with no friends, I spent a whole lot of time reading. I mean, books were my friends, and I would commune with them in the hallowed halls of my Imagination. Not really - that was a kind of joke. But I had a lot of time on my hands, and what else are you going to do when there's nothing on TV? Like most people, I began flirting with the YA genre by reading the sexy books that I was supposed to be too young for, particularly the ones about girls (there weren't actually all that many sexy ones concerning boys) as a kind of research project for a potential future career as a Great Lover of Women. Most of what I imagined I learned about girls and human relationships from these books, admittedly, turned out to be almost wholly inaccurate, but never mind. Then, when I was the age you're supposed to be when you read teen lit, I tended to avoid it and read &quot;adult books&quot; and &quot;classics&quot; instead. <br><br>Then as an older teenager, I worked at the local public library. That job was, once again, like being a kid with no friends, in that I tended to have a lot of time on my hands. So, for something to do in the down time, I assigned myself a little project of reading every book in the Children's Fiction section, from beginning to end, in alphabetical order. I didn't love them all, but I loved a lot of them. (My favorites were darker, psychological studies like those of Robert Cormier, or ultra-wacky stuff like Ellen Raskin&#8212;but I gave everything a shot.) I continued to read YA books through my alleged adulthood. And now I read them not only for enjoyment and what I think they call &quot;enrichment,&quot; but also out of professional interest, i.e., checking out the competition. <br><br>I have been too young, too old, then way too old, but in a lifetime of doing things I'm technically not supposed to do, few forbidden experiences have been as powerful, as inspiring, or as cool as this habit of always reading the wrong books. And now I'm writing them, too. Long live age-inappropriateness.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/60454

Her parents, aunts and uncles and grandparents were all forced out of their homes after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when all Japanese Canadians on Canada&rsquo;s West Coast were, she says, &ldquo;herded into the exhibition grounds in Vancouver where for several months they slept in horse stalls.&rdquo; Able-bodied men were then sent away to work, the others transported to live in camps of tarpaper shacks in the mountains. When the war ended with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japanese Canadians were allowed to resettle only in designated areas of eastern Canada. Sakamoto&rsquo;s grandparents lost the homes and businesses they had worked so hard to acquire.<br><br> Kerri grew up in mostly white suburban Etobicoke of the 1960s and &rsquo;70s; her parents avoided talking about the camps, or even about Japanese culture and history, even though racial taunts were a fact of life. She found out about the internment camps at the age of twenty, reading a magazine article. She read Joy Kogawa&rsquo;s <i>Obasan</i> and worked with Kogawa in the redress movement for two years, although her parents refused to attend the meetings. &ldquo;It was the idea of being visible once again that was uncomfortable for them.&rdquo; She felt compelled to write about the internment and its residual effects.<br><br> She had studied English and French at the University of Toronto, published some short stories, but then wasn&rsquo;t sure how she would make a living. She worked in a range of jobs, often in libraries. Aged thirty, panicking about whether she would ever become a writer, she applied and was accepted to the creative writing program at New York University, where she studied with E.L. Doctorow and Peter Carey. She stayed in New York for six years, enjoying the talks and readings and films, and wrote about art for a gallery. By the time her work permit ran out, exciting things were happening in Canadian literature and she felt optimistic about returning to Canada; soon after her return, <i>The Electrical Field</i>, which she began writing while at NYU, was accepted for publication.<br><br> Kerri&rsquo;s second novel, <i>One Hundred Million Hearts,</i> examined the many Canadian- and American-born Japanese men who were in Japan at the start of the war and joined the military. Suffering racism in North America but aliens in Japan, they were not accepted anywhere. &ldquo;It was absolutely conceivable that some of the kamikaze might have been American- or Canadian-born&hellip; I think if you&rsquo;re anxious to prove your authenticity and your allegiance, what more definitive way to do that?&rdquo; She spent four months of 1999 in Japan doing research. Unable to speak the language, she experienced being a cultural outsider as she visited war museums, and tracked down memoirs and wartime propaganda. The novel, which took five years to complete, reflects her interest in memory and the splintering of history. <br> &#160;<br> Kerri&rsquo;s third novel, <i>Floating City, </i>tells the story of a fiercely ambitious boy who overcomes humble beginnings and hardship in British Columbia to become a wealthy property developer in Toronto, but cannot escape the ghosts of his past. While the novel&rsquo;s early inspiration came from family history, its scope expanded dramatically when Kerri learned that visionary American architect Buckminster Fuller had once designed a futuristic development that included floating housing pods in Toronto harbour. Fuller appears in the book as the protagonist&rsquo;s mentor, giving rise to one of its many conflicts&mdash;altruism versus ambition, modernity versus tradition, and clashing ideas about belonging and inclusion.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/26699

And so I thought, what if you did dwell upon it?&#160; What exactly would you see?&#160; <br><br>Months later I found myself on the winning end of a stack of history books about &ldquo;resurrection men&rdquo;&mdash;nineteenth-century grave robbers hired to steal bodies for use in medical school dissections.&#160; You might expect I&rsquo;d be disgusted at their adventures; instead, I found myself greatly impressed.&#160; There was an art to it.&#160; And like all arts, it was something that could be passed down, master to apprentice, or&mdash;even more interesting to me as an author&mdash;father to son.<br><br><u>THE CHALLENGE<br></u><br><i>Rotters</i> is a story about a boy named Joey Crouch who loses everything&mdash;his mother, his friends, his home, even his one talent is rendered useless&mdash;and then out of desperation turns to Ken Harnett, his mysterious and threatening biological father, only to find that Harnett is, in fact, the dad he&rsquo;s always needed.&#160; And this truth is in spite of&mdash;or maybe partly because of&mdash;what he does in graveyards under the cover of night.<br><br>I knew right away the biggest challenge in writing the book would be to generate sympathy for people who did something so repugnant.&#160; But I also knew right away that sympathy was possible, because the passing on of treasured information is by its very nature a tender act.&#160; Even Harnett&rsquo;s initial coldness is a form of tenderness: it&rsquo;s meant to turn Joey away from a dangerous and lonely life.&#160; When Joey is finally let in, he suffers a training period as cruel as that of any budding concert pianist, but what drives this merciless routine is, once again, love.&#160; The secrets Harnett reveal to Joey are no less than the secrets of mortality and how we deal with the promise of our own demise.&#160; It&rsquo;s heavy stuff, no doubt.&#160; But if handled with a little style and a lot of guts, I knew it could be the stuff of great literature, too.<br>&#160;<br><u>THE DARKNESS<br></u><br>We&rsquo;ve all seen those time-lapse films of the decomposition of a dead animal.&#160; At first, it&rsquo;s gross.&#160; But then the flesh&rsquo;s constant reinvention becomes fascinating, and, after a while, even sort of beautiful.&#160; It is my hope that Rotters has a similar effect&mdash;that if we, writer and reader, look hard enough together at something ugly, it might just transform into something magnificent.<br><br>Even before joining his father in the family business, the complications in Joey&rsquo;s life are legion: he&rsquo;s an outcast and his dad is the town pariah&mdash;not to mention that awful smell.&#160; But these burdens are nothing when compared to those of the men Joey meets: the underworld of grave robbers known as the Diggers.&#160; These Diggers are proud knights fighting for a dying kingdom and have given their entire lives to a labor no one will ever appreciate.&#160; Joey&rsquo;s arrival and his relationship with Harnett forces the Diggers to wonder if they&rsquo;ve wasted their lives.&#160; Surely no lurker of graveyards deserves a gift as great as love.&#160; This is a world of darkness that Joey has plunged into&mdash;and we haven&rsquo;t even gotten to Harnett&rsquo;s would-be brother Boggs, whose jealousy runs so deep that he&rsquo;ll stop at almost nothing to make Joey his own son.<br><br>Darkness is a defining characteristic of <i>Rotters</i>.&#160; But it&rsquo;s worthy to remember that darkness is just that&mdash;it&rsquo;s dark&mdash;and what is being concealed in the dark is not just the horrible and fearsome, it&rsquo;s also the inspirational and moving.&#160; Horror means nothing without happiness; dark means nothing without light.&#160; <i>Rotters</i> may make you feel scared, but hopefully it will also make you simply feel.&#160; It&rsquo;s that kind of book, or at least I hope it is.<br>&#160;<br>- Daniel Kraus",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/89150

754,Rudy,Wiebe,False,False,"Rudy Wiebe was born on October 4, 1934, in an isolated farm community of about 250 people in a rugged but lovely region near Fairholme, Saskatchewan. His parents had escaped Soviet Russia with five children in 1930, part of the last generation of homesteaders to settle the Canadian West, and part of a Mennonite history of displacement and emigration through Europe and Asia to North and South America since the seventeenth century. In 1947 his family gave up their bush farm and moved to Coaldale, Alberta, a town east of Lethbridge peopled largely by Ukrainians, Mennonites, Mormons, and Central Europeans, as well as Japanese, who ended up there during WW II.<br><br>Rudy Wiebe read as much as possible from an early age; his first reading materials were the Bible, the Eaton's catalogue and the <i>Free Press Weekly Prairie Farmer</i>; he also recalls listening to his parents&#8217; stories of Russia. By Grade 4, he had read through the two shelves of books available in the one-room schoolhouse. Growing up, he enjoyed <b>Les Miserables, Toilers of the Sea, David Copperfield, Tom Brown's Schooldays</b>, Greek myths and Norse legends. Later an admirer of Faulkner, M&#225;rquez, Borges and Tolstoy, Wiebe has always held to the fundamentals of plot, character and, above all, story. He believes stories should begin in the specific and local but expand into &#8220;a human truth larger than any individual.&#8221;<br><br>Wiebe won his first prize for fiction while studying literature at the University of Alberta, where he enrolled in a writing class and began producing poems, plays and stories. His winning story in a Canada-wide contest recounted a young boy&#8217;s response to the death of his sister &#8211; based on Wiebe&#8217;s own experience &#8211; and was published in the magazine <i>Liberty</i> in 1956. After earning his B.A., Wiebe left for the ancient University of T&#252;bingen in West Germany on a Rotary Fellowship to study literature and theology, an experience that increased his respect for older and richer communities. Tena Isaak of British Columbia joined him there and they were married. The couple travelled in England, Austria, Switzerland and Italy before returning to Edmonton, where Wiebe completed his M.A. in creative writing. His thesis grew into his first novel, <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b>. <br><br>In 1962 Wiebe earned a Bachelor of Theology degree from the Mennonite Brethren Bible College; he considered becoming a minister. He was editor of Winnipeg&#8217;s <i>Mennonite Brethren Herald</i> when <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b><i> </i>was published. Many conservative ministers and Mennonites in small towns objected to the novel's frank and at times unflattering portrait of community life, and there was considerable opposition to the book. &#8220;I wasn't exactly sacked as editor . . . but the committee came to me and said &#8216;Ahem.&#8217; I resigned.&#8221; The strength of this reaction made him think hard about the power of the written word, and reinforced his sense of wanting to be a writer.<br><br>Wiebe then was invited to teach at a Mennonite college in Goshen, an agricultural town in Indiana with a large Mennonite and Amish population, where he would be Assistant Professor of English from 1963 to 1967. Goshen College was a lively and stimulating intellectual community where Wiebe committed himself to writing, study, teaching and travel. &#8220;I encountered men and women of real perception . . . really literate Christians who saw themselves as Jesus's followers and at the same time were acquainted with the thoughts of others and had brought that kind of understanding to bear on what it means to be a Christian. The best thing that ever happened to me was the meetings we had every two or three weeks in one home or another &#8211; seven or eight of us, a psychiatrist, a couple of theologians, a couple of literary people. There were the best theologians there, I think, the Mennonite Church has ever had.&#8221; <br><br>Wiebe published his second novel, <b>First and Vital Candle</b>, and began to explore the western United States and the Mennonite settlements in Paraguay. He returned to Edmonton as a professor in creative writing and English at the University of Alberta, and immersed himself in Canadian literature. He wrote reviews, essays and articles, edited anthologies and was soon established as a major figure in Canadian letters. In 1973, his novel <b>The Temptations of Big Bear</b> won a Governor General's Award. Since then he has continued to win the highest praise for his books of fiction and non-fiction. He has written numerous film and television scripts, lectured internationally from Denmark to India, and given readings from Adelaide to Puerto Rico to Helsinki and Igloolik. For thirty years he taught literature and creative writing at colleges and universities in Canada, the United States and Germany. Now retired from teaching, his former students include such accomplished writers as Myrna Kostash, Aritha van Herk, Thomas Wharton and Katherine Govier.<br>  <br>Wiebe was called the first major Mennonite writer to place his community&#8217;s experience in a broader framework. Mennonites assert the fundamental authority of Scripture, especially the New Testament, as a practical guide to life. But while Wiebe imbues his work with a deep moral seriousness, his focus has always been on narrative. &#8220;I never consciously think of writing a so-called Christian novel. I don&#8217;t think Albert Camus ever thought of writing an existentialist novel, either. I think of getting at, of building, a story.&#8221; As a prairie writer, he has often concerned himself with Native stories, feeling place of birth to be more important than blood ancestry. &#8220;Those Mennonite villages in Russia are my heritage, but not my world. The world I feel and sense in my bones is the bush of northern Saskatchewan, of prairie Canada.&#8221; Native spirituality, with its vital links to the physical world, has always attracted him. But his fiction manages to transcend nationality and locale to explore the struggles of communities and individuals; his books and stories have been translated into nine European languages, as well as Chinese, Japanese and Hindi.<br><br>Whatever Wiebe&#8217;s focus in a given work, he has always chosen ambitious themes, and his work rewards readers with an intensity seldom rivalled. He is a voice of Canadian fiction that cannot be ignored, and whose work promises to endure.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/33129

792,Chris,Raschka,False,False,"I&rsquo;m sometimes asked about my general approach to illustration, which has over the years come to be described as minimal. Hmm, I&rsquo;m not sure minimal is such a complimentary term, but I&rsquo;ll accept it. I wasn&rsquo;t always minimal. In the early days I was laying it on as thickly as I could, trying very hard to get it right. But I found that the harder I tried, the more tired whatever it was I was working on looked. And then I grew tired of it as well.<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;There is too much sweat in it,&rdquo; is how my friend, the artist Vladimir Radunsky, would put it.&#160;<br> &#160;<br> Perhaps he means that there has been an imposition of too much of my will upon the material with which I was working. It is an offhand remark of Wordsworth&rsquo;s that helped me when I needed a new way to move forward: &ldquo;The matter always comes out of the manner.&rdquo; How you say something has direct bearing on what you say.<br> &#160;<br> So, if you labor heavily upon a work of art, then part of what you are saying is, this is a heavy work of art. If you happen to be trying to say something about lightness, then the art should be light as well.<br> &#160;<br> It is much the same with food. There are heavy meals and light meals. There are sauces that contain endless lists of ingredients, and there are sauces that contain only a few but in exquisite proportion. Does an apple taste best bitten directly into, sliced thinly with a light squeeze of lemon, or baked for an hour with nutmeg, sugar, cinnamon, flour and egg whites? Maybe the answer is that there is a time for all of those things.<br> &#160;<br> My answer in my illustration has been to allow the materials to speak as directly as possible. I want each and every entire brushstroke to be seen. I want the marks made by the tip of the brush to carry as much meaning as the marks made by the dragging tail end, the part that splits open as the paint pulls away, thins and dries. I want each brushstroke to have a beginning, a middle, and an end, a story in itself and a life in itself. Then the life of this brushstroke can wrestle with the life of the brushstroke next to it. There is enough action there between two brushstrokes for a little story. And what happens when the next brushstroke comes in a different color?&#160;<br> &#160;<br> It could be epic. Of course, if it&rsquo;s just brushstrokes wrestling around, it isn&rsquo;t much of a picture book is it? There still has to be a picture. And maybe it needs to be a picture of a dog named Daisy or a little girl riding a bike. So I have to be careful before I get too carried away in the manner itself.<br> &#160;<br> In the end, this is how it goes in my books. There are always two stories happening: one is me having fun watching brushstrokes wrestle, and the other is the story told in pictures and words on a page. It may be minimal, but it&rsquo;s enough for me.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/67939

I had finished a middle-grade novel, <i>The World&#8217;s Most Disgusting Sandwich</i>, and was trying to get it published.<br>&#8220;It has potential,&#8221; a potential agent told me. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to see other books you&#8217;ve written.&#8221;<br>Other books I&#8217;d written? I hadn&#8217;t written any other books. I had written an anonymous poetry column for a teachers&#8217; newsletter. I had written a bunch of essays in college and graduate school. I had written some irreverent songs to play on my guitar. &#8220;This is my first book,&#8221; I confessed. <br>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t typically represent books, we represent writers. Are you working on something else?&#8221;<br>I had started on a sequel and began to tell her about it.<br>&#8220;I mean something different,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to see what else you can do.&#8221;<br>Oh, crap. &#8220;I have a few other ideas,&#8221; I said. <br>She told me when I had something written she&#8217;d be happy to take a look.<br>So I came up with a new idea in a hurry and started writing the fictional memoir of Zeke Zagger, the world&#8217;s greatest super villain that nobody had ever heard of. It was supposed to be funny; instead it was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful. Reading over the first 20 pages, I began to worry about the state of my subconscious. <br><br>So I decided to try again with a new character, and the first thing I wanted to do was give him a name. Shakespeare. Shakespeare Shapiro. Wow, I thought, imagine being that kid. So I did imagine it, and I started to vent on paper. It turned out Shakespeare Shapiro had a lot to say, not just about his name, but also about his crazy parents, his maddeningly popular younger brother, his social ineptitude, and the overall catastrophe of his life. Much of what he said was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful; but it was also really funny to me. And I guess it was funny to other people, too, because <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is set to hit the bookstores on September 25, 2007.<br><br>As an eighth-grade teacher, it is both incredibly exciting and a little bit nerve wracking to have written a book that I know my students&#8211;and probably their parents&#8211;will read. I&#8217;m excited to become a minor celebrity for the first time in my life, at least within the walls of Manhattan&#8217;s Middle School 255. I&#8217;m excited that my students will see me as a real live writer, and I will be thrilled if more of them are inspired to carry on independent writing lives. But I wonder how they and their parents will react to the fact that the book deals so openly with the kinds of things teenage boys think about. Just imagine parent-teacher conferences, if you will: <br> <br><b>PARENT #1</b>: So, Jake, we read your book.<br><br><b>ME</b> (<i>smiling nervously)</i>: Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you how Becky is doing in class. Her writing is&#8211;<br><br><b>PARENT #2 </b><i>(holding up a copy)</i>: Masturbation. Drug use. Pornography. You seem quite well versed in these subjects . . .<br><br>You get the idea. So to the question of how much of <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is autobiographical, let me just say that nothing has ever been proven.

Somewhere between living in Ireland, England, and the United States; teaching English as a second language and working as a food journalist; and starting a family; Park finally realized that what she really wanted to do was to write books for children.

846,Stephanie,Hemphill,False,False,"Because in her journals, letters, and fiction, Sylvia un-bandages wounds and wonders that most people don&#8217;t want to admit exist. Because she tells dangerous truths. &#8220;This is what it is like to be complete. It is horrible.&#8221; <br><br>Sylvia forges through the crests and the crashes of self-examination for us on her pages. Her writing binds me to her, close, under her skull and skin. And I think that may be one of the primary things great writing can do&#8211; become your companion.<br><br>And what an insightful companion she is! Tossing off lines like &#8220;The courage of a shut mouth, in spite of artillery!&#8221; When I read, &#8220;It was a place of force&#8212;the wind gagging my mouth with my own blown hair,&#8221; her expression of <i>my own experiences </i>seemed uncanny. I have lived in that boxed space of being in a relationship with someone by choice and yet feeling that I had no choice but to stay, as I had willingly put myself in that cage. And yet when I wrote about this, my own words did not express my feelings as well as Sylvia had. She understood me, and said it best. <br><br>Sylvia even writes with clarity about not being able to write. In some sense almost everyone has experienced the dreadful blank page, the cursor blinking on an empty document, the e-mail that you just don&#8217;t know how to begin. Fingers drum the keyboard, but can&#8217;t depress any letters. Sylvia&#8217;s journals keep me company when this happens. She too, even though she wrote voluminously, struggled with feeling empty and unable to push a pen across paper. And when she couldn&#8217;t write, like me, she turned to baked goods! Sylvia created them, while I only consume them, but still I feel we have this in common. <br><br>So why did I write <i>this</i> book, now? Others have already written Sylvia&#8217;s biography. Sylvia&#8217;s own daughter has expressed the opinion that people should leave the story of hermother&#8217;s life alone. How then could I justify writing this book? Why should I convey how I see Sylvia&#8217;s life? <br><br>Honestly, part of writing <i>Your Own, Sylvia</i> was a willful denial on my part of what I was undertaking. How could I possibly write a whole book of poems about Sylvia Plath? They would never hold up under the weight of her talent. But somehow I let that go. I thought about the first time I came to Plath in the classroom. I knew little about her life, not much beyond the fact that she killed herself. And although I admired her writing, I could not initially see its depth. Sylvia&#8217;s work seemed difficult, purposely obtuse, and so I dismissed pieces of hers as remote and even cold. But learning about her life helped me to unpack various themes and metaphors that would otherwise have remained closed to me. Instead of being cold, I saw that Sylvia&#8217;s writing borders on frenzy at times. She holds her work close to her and you feel its heat and impact. I don&#8217;t think it always follows that knowing a writer&#8217;s biography is essential to understanding their work, but the knowledge I gained about Sylvia&#8217;s life as I researched and wrote this book enhanced my experience of her writing. I had always loved her poems&#8217; fabulous opening lines, such as: &#8220;Viciousness in the kitchen,&#8221;-Lesbos ;&#8220;Stasis in darkness,&#8221;-Ariel; and &#8220;Even the sun-clouds this morning cannot manage such skirts&#8221;-Poppies in October. When I found out what was going on in Sylvia&#8217;s life at the time she penned each of these lines, the words resonated with even greater impact. My book offers a window into Sylvia&#8217;s life in the hopes of helping readers appreciate her writing more fully.<br><br>Sylvia published her first poem at eight and wrote until her last days, creating astonishing work whether she was serene, joyful, or in crisis. Her writing captivates and inspires me. She is a friend that is always there on the bookshelf when I need her, with a great line, a brilliant sentence, to pull me through. I wish that her own words could have done the same for her. And I hope my book leads you to her.",https://images.randomhouse.com/author/70523

924,Troy,Cummings,False,False,"Everywhere I go -- from the lowliest, grubbiest pawn shop in town to the swankiest, fanciest pawn shop in town -- people always ask the same questions: ""Where are you from? Were you a nerdy kid? How did you wind up becoming a writer-slash-illustrator?&rdquo;<br>&#160;<br>I sort of shrug and try to change the subject, but for some reason they won't let it go.<br>&#160;<br>""No, really,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;We sincerely and frequently want to know!&rdquo;&#160; At this point, I reach into my backpack and hand them a little pamphlet. This is what it says:<br>&#160;<br><b>Regularly Posed Inquiries (RPIs)</b><br>&#160;<br><b>1. Where are you from?</b><br>I grew up in the middle of the woods near Cunot, Indiana. I had dogs, ducks, chickens, sisters and a baby brother. (Hi, Nate!) We played in the woods all the time, which is pretty great when you think about it.<br>&#160;<br><b>2. Were you a nerdy kid?</b><br>No way.&#160; Everyone in school gave me the respect that a level 12 Paladin (with +4 &#160;Boots of Dexterity) deserves.<br>&#160;<br><b>3. How did you wind up becoming a writer-slash-illustrator?</b><br>In grade school, I spent most of my leisure time drawing comics. Around fifth grade or so, I created my masterpiece: a comic called &ldquo;Star Quack.&rdquo;&#160; It was an epic story about a duck and robot who tried to explore the universe but always wound up getting attacked by intergalactic space monsters. (Write what you know.)<br>&#160;<br>I went on to draw cartoons for my high school and college newspapers. (I recommend becoming a staff artist for a school paper &ndash; they have lots of space to fill and will accept anything you submit. Even if it&rsquo;s a weekly comic strip titled &ldquo;Death By Bear Attack.&rdquo;)<br>&#160;<br>Then, like a lot of people in their early 20s, I started to experiment with graphic design. At first it was just once or twice a month &ndash; a logo here, a T-shirt there.&#160; But pretty soon I was designing newspaper pages, laying out posters, and editing photos almost every day.&#160; I even learned what &ldquo;kerning&rdquo; was.<br>&#160;<br>This led to internships and jobs at a bunch of newspapers and Web sites, which in turn led to my becoming a full-time illustrator.&#160; Slash-writer.<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br><b>4. Do you think that really what it all boils down to is that you just have to keep at it?&#160; In other words, once you stop writing, then it&rsquo;s really hard to start again? And that the same goes for drawing?&#160; Or even playing the saxophone? &#160;Oh, and also that the more you create, the easier it is to create the next thing, be it writing a story or drawing a picture or sculpting a national park out of mashed potatoes or anything, really?</b><br><b>&#160;</b><br>Yes.<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br><b>5. Finally, do you have four helpful tips for people who want to become writers-slash-illustrators?</b><br>&#160;<br>Of course! Here you go.<br>&#160;<br>1) Take all your notes on legal paper.&#160; The size of the paper doesn&rsquo;t matter, just as long as you&rsquo;ve obtained it without breaking the law.<br>&#160;<br>2) Do all your sketches with a fancy pen. This will impress everyone in the coffee shop, even if your artwork is just so-so. I prefer the Finial-Weatherford broad point fountain pen, with a no. 3 ox-tooth nib, enamel-plated quills, and two eyes made out of coal.<br>&#160;<br>3) Make sure your computer is up to date.&#160; (Rule of thumb: a good writing computer should weigh at least seven pounds.&#160; Twice that if you&rsquo;re planning to write a teenage vampire romance.)<br>&#160;<br>4) Stuck on the ending?

927,David Adams,Richards,False,False,"Born in 1950 in Newcastle, New Brunswick, David Adams Richards was the third of William and Margaret Richards' six children. He found his calling at the age of fourteen, after reading <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and embarked on a life of extraordinary purpose, one which he says didn't help his finances: ""Sometimes .&#160;.&#160;. I thought it would be better if I were a plumber, but I wouldn't be very good.""<br><br>At the age of twenty and after finishing his first novel, <i>The Keeping of Gusties</i>, Richards went in search of a community of writers. His quest ended when he met a group of academics at the University of New Brunswick. Richards would hitch-hike from his home in Newcastle to Fredericton every Tuesday night to meet with them and read from his work. The literary evenings were held on campus at McCourt Hall, in an outbuilding formally used to store ice. The group quickly became known as the Ice House Gang. There he received encouragement from established writers, including the late Alden Nowlan, whom he names as important influences along with Faulkner, Pushkin, Dostoevsky and Emily Bront&euml;. It was during his time with these writers that Richards wrote two-thirds of his second novel, <i>The Coming of Winter</i>, which was published by Oberon Press in 1974.<br><br>In 1971, Richards married Peggy McIntyre. They spent the first years of their marriage travelling throughout Canada, Europe and Australia. It was on these long sojourns away from the Mirimachi that Richards found he could write about the home he loved, regardless of where he lived. As he continued to write, Richards took postings as writer-in-residence at universities in New Brunswick, Ontario, Alberta and at Hollins University in Roanoke, Virginia. In 1997, they moved to Toronto with their sons John Thomas and Anton.<br><br>The Miramichi region has continued as the heart of Richards' fiction throughout his career. As he explained in an interview with <i>January</i> <i>Magazine</i>, his connection to the area and to the rural lives of its inhabitants is central to his fiction, yet does not reflect a limited scope: ""It's very important, because the characters come from the soil. They're like the trees, in a certain respect. They cling to that river and that soil, but as Jack Hodgins once said about my writing&mdash;which was one of the kindest things any writer has said about my writing&mdash;he said: 'David, you aren't writing about the Miramichi Valley, you're writing about Campbell River where I come from. Because every character you talk about is a character I've met here in Campbell River.' And that's basically what I'm doing. Of course my people are Miramichi. Of course they come from the fabric and the soil of the Miramichi but if that was the only thing that was interesting about them, I wouldn't bother writing about them.""<br><br>The relocation to Toronto was not without its difficulties, though. As Richards documented in the memoir <i>Lines on the Water</i>, he loves fly-fishing on the Miramichi River. Yet once he was no longer a resident, he was unable to get a fishing licence for the region. Thankfully, said Richards, the local government proclaimed him an ""honorary Miramichier""&mdash;""So I can go fishing. It was very nice of them and very touching."" He has also written a non-fiction book on the place of hockey in the Canadian soul, called <i>Hockey Dreams</i>.<br><br>Richards has received numerous awards and prizes throughout his career. Most notably, he is one of few writers in the history of the Governor General's Literary Awards to win in both the fiction (<i>Nights Below Station Street</i>) and non-fiction (<i>Lines on the Water</i>) categories. In addition to these two wins, he was nominated for <i>Road to the Stilt House</i> (in 1985), <i>For Those Who Hunt the Wounded Down</i> (in 1993) and <i>Mercy Among the Children</i> (in 2000). Considered by many to be Richards' most accomplished novel, <i>Mercy</i> was co-winner of the Giller Award in 2000, and was shortlisted for the Trillium Award and the Thomas Raddell Award. It also won the Canadian Booksellers Association author of the year and fiction book of the year awards. Over the years, Richards has also won countless regional awards for his novels and was awarded the prestigious Canada-Australia Literary Prize in 1992. More recently,&#160;<i>The Lost Highway</i>&#160;was shortlisted for the Governor General&rsquo;s Literary Award and longlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and&#160;<i>The Friends of Meagre Fortune</i>&#160;won the Commonwealth Writers&rsquo; Prize for Best Book and was longlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize.&#160;<br><br>Despite all of these successes, it was years before Richards made money at writing. He laughs at the sales of his early work: ""For a long while if I sold 200 books, I'd be saying: Oh, great! And, you know, a $50 advance! That's great. I only worked three years, I don't know if I can spend $50.""<br><br>Also a screenwriter, Richards has adapted a number of his novels for the small screen. In 1990, he adapted his novel <i>Nights Below Station Street</i>, and in 1994 he penned the teleplay ""Small Gifts,"" for which he won his first Gemini. He won his second for his screen adaptation of <i>For Those Who Hunt the Wounded Down</i>, and later co-wrote the screenplay for<i> The Bay of Love and Sorrows</i>, released as a feature film in 2002.<br><br>In addition to his novels and non-fiction books, Richards' short stories and articles have been published in literary magazines and anthologies.

In the early sixties, when all of her children were finally in school, Snyder began to think about writing again. &ldquo;Writing for children hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me when I was younger, but nine years of teaching in the upper elementary grades had given me a deep appreciation of the gifts and graces that are specific to individuals with 10 or 11 years of experience as human beings.
