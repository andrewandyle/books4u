She started her first novel, <i>A Thousand Never Evers</i>, while teaching sixth grade in Massachusetts, and she hired her former students to critique the first draft. &#8220;Their advice was right on the money,&#8221; she says. Prior to teaching sixth grade, Shana worked on a Mississippi community nutrition project, and at Facing History and Ourselves, an educational nonprofit. Shana majored in English at the University of Pennsylvania, graduated with a Master in Public Policy from Harvard&#8217;s Kennedy School of Government, and received a Master of Arts in Teaching from Simmons College.<br></b><br><br>I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1968. My parents had moved there from New York several years earlier so that my father could work as a lawyer in the civil rights movement. Although we moved to Massachusetts when I was still a baby, I grew up hearing amazing stories about the struggle for justice and equality. I remember my father talking about the segregated maternity wards in Birmingham, where white women could recover from childbirth in semi-private rooms with air conditioning, while black women were forced to recover in 16-bed wards in sweltering heat. It was stories like this that sparked my interest in the civil rights movement.<br><br>Some upsetting things happened during my middle and high school years that made me think a lot about discrimination and equality. For example, in high school social studies, we sat alphabetically by last name. It so happened that in my corner of the class were all Jews and an African American girl. My teacher called our corner &#8220;the ghetto.&#8221; He&#8217;d say, &#8220;Would someone in the ghetto like to answer this question?&#8221; And in gym class, during floor hockey games, boys shoved my close friend into the wall and whispered &#8220;Kike&#8221; in his ear. <br><br>In high school, as part of ninth-grade English, I took a class called Facing History and Ourselves. This course challenged me to see connections between events in history and the ethical choices I made each day. My teacher, Jan Darsa, actually talked about things that mattered: why friends turn on each other, why kids are afraid to stand up to bullies, and how easy it is to go along with the crowd. We talked about the Holocaust. And then we talked about how people throughout history have stood up and fought against injustice.&#160;That class had a big impact on me. (So much so that many years later, I went to work for the Facing History and Ourselves organization.)<br><br>Throughout my school years, I remained interested in human and civil rights. In college, during one spring break, my father brought my sister and me to Birmingham, Alabama, to meet his former law partner and his other friends from back in the 1960s. I remember driving by the Sixteenth Street Birmingham Baptist Church with a friend of my father&#8217;s. She told us she had been there the day it was bombed, and that one of her best friends, 11-year-old Denise McNair, had been killed. That really shook me to the core.<br><br>After college and graduate school, I got a job with a Mississippi community nutrition project. I was based in Boston, but spoke on the phone regularly with local residents of the Mississippi Delta. I had the opportunity to spend time in the Delta too. As someone who&#8217;d grown up in the Northeast, I was immediately grabbed by the warmth, friendliness, and good humor of the people I met there. And I was struck by the incredible poverty&#8211;poverty that I&#8217;d expect to see in a developing country. I was shocked that there were still segregated schools and towns divided between the black and white sides by railroad tracks running through the middle.<br><br>The more I learned about policy related to hunger, poverty, and education, the more I wanted to work directly with young people, so I decided to go back to school and get my degree in teaching. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. I love being in the classroom. Talk about an adventure! You never know what&#8217;s going to happen on any given day. Middle school students are so creative, hilarious, and real. <br><br>It was spring. I was teaching a unit on elements of fiction to my sixth graders. I read picture books to help them understand plot, character, theme, conflict, setting, etc. For homework each night, I&#8217;d give an assignment that would help them develop their own creative stories. One day, in the midst of this unit, my students and I had the opportunity to visit with the incredibly talented author David Almond. We&#8217;d read his book <i>Skellig</i> aloud. Now I&#8217;d always written short stories, poems, and newspaper articles&#8211;and I can&#8217;t tell you exactly what David Almond said that did it&#8211;but I left his talk completely fired up to start writing a book for my students.<br><br>That afternoon, as soon as I got home from school, I did the homework that I&#8217;d assigned my class. That&#8217;s when this 12-year-old African American girl popped in my head. She was sitting on the bank of the bayou, absolutely panic stricken. At the time, I didn&#8217;t know who she was, what year it was, or why this girl was so freaked out. I started free writing to find out. Eight years later, I finished <i>A Thousand Never Evers</i>. Now finally, I'm thrilled to say, I'm ready to share Addie Ann Pickett's story with the world."

44,True,Eileen,Eileen Spinelli,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/72956,Spinelli,False,"I, Jerry Spinelli, am writing this myself without help from my wife and fellow author, Eileen, because I need to do some bragging about her. It was her idea that led to our first book together: <i>Today I Will</i>. She remembered reading daily devotionals, and it occurred to her that young readers might like a day-by-day book based on literature.<br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;There's a page in <i>Today I Will</i> for every day in the year&mdash;that&rsquo;s 366 pages/days, including leap year. Each page starts with a quote from children's or young adult literature. Then comes a commentary on the quote, followed by a resolution&mdash;that is, how you can apply the message to your day. The idea is that you take a minute to read the day's page when you get up in the morning. It helps to give your day a little direction.<br>&#160;&#160;<br><i>&#160;Today I Will </i>is just the latest in a long parade of ideas that Eileen has blessed me with. The sequel to <i>Stargirl</i>&mdash;<i>Love, Stargirl</i>&mdash;is one. The <i>Stargirl Journal </i>is another. &#160;<br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;Speaking of <i>Stargirl,</i> I guess you could say she gave me the idea for that one too, even though she never realized it. Listening to her talk about her childhood over the years, and getting to know this special person I happen to be married to, I found myself using Eileen again and again as my model as I developed the character of Susan Caraway, who names herself Stargirl. Two examples: Stargirl keeps notes on other people, so she knows when their birthdays are, what they like to eat, etc; and Stargirl has a &ldquo;happy wagon.&rdquo; I lifted both of these features from Eileen&rsquo;s personal history.<br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;She does more than supply me with ideas. She&rsquo;s my first reader and editor. When I finish a chapter, I put it on her desk. (We each have an office in our house.) She tells me if it&rsquo;s good (I go, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;) or not (I re-write). I do the same for her. It works so well for us, I sometimes wonder how any author can manage without a writing spouse. <br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;Sometimes we get asked: &ldquo;Do you compete with each other?&rdquo; The question always surprises us. The fact is, we are each other&rsquo;s biggest cheerleader. If Eileen writes a bestseller, I&rsquo;m probably happier about it than she is. There are no losers in our house.<br>&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;People who know we have seventeen grandchildren (at last count) often want to know if we get ideas from them. The answer is: Yes, we do. But there are many more sources to get stories from. We get story ideas from each other and from reading the newspaper and from memories of our own kidhoods and just from ordinary everyday life. &#160;<br>&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;With all this writing stuff going on in our House of Two Authors, you might wonder that it took us this long to write a book together. Actually, we did try it once before, years ago. It was a story about ideas in the form of cute, furry little creatures running around the house. That story was one idea we could have done without. It flopped."

I think I must have thought that books were born on the library shelves. But I was good at writing stories, and I had a good deal of practice.<br><br>My primary school teacher came in every Monday morning in the worst of moods. 'Fetch my bag'. He'd lay his leather strap across the front of his desk as a threat or warning. Then he'd turn and chalk up three titles on the board: <i>A Day in the Life of a Lost Umbrella, My Best Friend, The Worst</i> <i>Advice I</i> <i>ever Took</i>; anything like that. Then: 'I want absolute silence till break-time' he'd say, nursing his hungover head. 'The first person to whisper gets the strap'.<br><br>I loved those double lessons more than anything in the world (except for reading). No endless discussions. No sharing of ideas. No realising that someone else had also had your brilliant idea. I covered reams of paper. I wrote fast. And I learned to judge the form and the length of a story. It was the best training I could ever have had, though I didn't know I'd be a writer.<br><br>I still work with a pencil and rubber in absolute silence. I still hide my work with my arms if anyone walks past, and I wouldn't dream of talking about what I'm writing or let a soul look at it until it's completely finished. Oh - and I still prefer reading other people's books to writing my own!<br><br>A lot of my work, even for fairly young readers, raises quite serious social issues. I believe that many personal decisions have a social or political resonance, and the way people try to pick their way through tricky family situations interests me. But people won't (and shouldn't) read books that don't hold their interest, and I still adore funny books. So since I write for the reader inside myself, I always end up with the kind of book I would have loved to read (if only someone else had bothered to write for me)."

When in doubt, keep it simple: here are a few insights into who I am and how I work. Ultimately, it&#8217;s all about the words and pictures and how they come to be.<br><br>Today, I write books and teach in San Francisco, but I&#8217;m a Chicago boy at heart. In the late-1970s, at the age of four, I moved to the Chicago suburbs. My formative memories are generally pretty pleasant; a mishmash of baseball, bikes, and bad haircuts while I navigated the social labyrinth of public schools. As a history teacher, I now realize that my childhood was typical of an American kid growing up in the 1980s: middle child of divorced parents, microwaving fish sticks, and watching too much television.<br><br>Thankfully, it wasn&#8217;t all fish sticks and TV. There were always books and I was a big reader. My parents were art historians and there was a lot of strange stuff to spark and stoke an inquisitive mind&#8211;books on Bosch and Beowulf, surrealist paintings, visiting artists, and mounds of comic books. It was rich fodder for a young mind and while I didn&#8217;t always understand what I was looking at, I knew I liked it.<br><br>I was an artist before I was a writer. We had a big drawing board at the Neff house&#8211;a battered, scribbled-over panel of wood that I would lay out on the floor. With pencil, pen, crayon, or markers, I would create whole worlds&#8211;taped together panoramas of monsters and knights and smoldering ruins. I loved monsters&#8211;from Grendel lurking outside Hrothgar&#8217;s hall, to the Minotaur, to the motley host in Sendak&#8217;s, <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>. If it had claws and teeth and malicious intent, I wanted to draw it. Still do.<br><br>My love of words came later. I don&#8217;t know exactly what triggered it, but I love the sounds, shapes, and mental snapshots that words can conjure. From the roar of creation myths to the quiet precision of a poem, there&#8217;s magic in words. The written word makes me feel a fierce connection to other people&#8211;I get to experience life through the soul and vitality of another human being. Even as you read these words, a connection is forming between us. We might be separated by great gulfs of distance or time, but still the connection exists. If that&#8217;s not magic, I don&#8217;t know what is.<br><br>While I love words and art, I didn&#8217;t make a go of them right away. As a senior at Cornell University, I planned to attend law school when I was contacted by a consulting firm and encouraged to apply for an interview. Upon further inspection, McKinsey &amp; Company sounded like heady stuff&#8211;a chance to work with smart people while tackling big problems. I decided law school could wait.<br><br>I spent five years in the business world and it was fine, but it just wasn&#8217;t me. Despite some brilliant colleagues and intriguing projects, I was plagued by the nagging suspicion that I was wasting my life. The real me wasn&#8217;t all that interested in a corner office&#8211;I wanted to be back at my drawing board, creating monsters and knights and ruins. Some might call such an impulse &#8220;geeky&#8221; or &#8220;childish,&#8221; but the older I get, the more I realize that we&#8217;re all strange little creatures and you have to build a life around whatever strange little things make you tick. It took nearly 30 years, but I finally concluded that I am a storyteller. I quit the corporate life cold turkey and took up teaching. During my first year teaching high school, I began to write <i>The Tapestry</i>.<br><br><i>The Tapestry </i>is a story that I would have loved as a boy. I don&#8217;t know how to write for an audience other than myself and I think the story would ring false if I tried. A fair amount of personal history is interwoven into the tale and its characters. For example, <i>vyes</i> are the byproduct of bad dreams I had as a boy, involving tall, wolfish creatures with squinty eyes. The nightmares were recurring and I would run into my parents&#8217; room, insisting that the &#8220;vyes&#8221; were after me. Naturally, when I needed a monster for <i>The Tapestry</i>, I put a call into the vyes. It was the least they could do after tormenting me so.<br><br>There are other bits and pieces of my life scattered throughout the books. An elderly married couple that I knew during college inspired the characters of Mum and Bob. A girlfriend&#8217;s father once asked me if I had read Dante in the original Italian (I had not). The presence of Old Tom at Rowan&#8211;its clock tower and its chimes&#8211;are a nod to Cornell&#8217;s Uris Library where I spent many an hour drowsing and watching snow settle onto the campus below. The list could go on. While personal anecdotes are nice, historic epics and mythology play a far greater role in shaping <i>The Tapestry</i>.<br><br>I must have been 10 or 11 when I first stumbled upon a book of Irish myths. Compared to the familiar fare of Greek and Norse mythology, the Irish tales seemed very exotic. Ireland&#8217;s stories and heroes possessed a beauty, savagery, and poetry that were magical, as were the names, which I still find a challenge. Central to Irish mythology is the hero, C&#250;chulain, and I could not ask for a more heroic or human persona on which to base Max McDaniels. In many ways, C&#250;chulain is the epitome of the tragic hero&#8211;he possesses both supernatural power and human foibles and thus makes for a fascinating character study. The myth of the <i>Tain Bo Cualnge</i>, or, <i>The Cattle Raid of Cooley</i>, likewise offered intriguing opportunities to explore heroism and hubris side by side.<br><br>The series also incorporates other genres&#8211;fantasy, science fiction, and real history&#8211;and the mix of these elements will shift from book to book. As a writer, I find the variety energizing as each new volume presents fundamentally new challenges and opportunities. To date, I&#8217;ve fleshed out detailed plans for over half a dozen books&#8211;some of which precede <i>The Hound of Rowan</i> by centuries&#8211;and I can safely say that no two are alike. I&#8217;d find each a joy to write because I&#8217;d find each a joy to read. This same mentality is applied to the illustrations.<br><br>When it comes to the drawings, I&#8217;m of the old school. Each of <i>The Tapestry&#8217;</i>s<i> </i>illustrations is a piece of original art. There is no PhotoShop&#8211;an application that has its uses, but is as pervasive these days as cosmetic surgery. I&#8217;d rather have a flawed drawing with a bit of sweat and fingerprints than a super-slick image that lives only on a server. The latter makes me sad. I have tremendous admiration for the work of some earlier illustrators&#8211;artists like Sydney Paget, Thomas Nast, and Arthur Rackham. I still pore over their drawings or political cartoons with love and awe and I&#8217;m firmly of the belief that the craft hit its zenith in the 19th and early 20th centuries. I try to emulate these old masters, employing the same tools&#8211;if not quite the same skills&#8211;in the illustration process. The drawings are created with an old-fashioned dip pen, paintbrushes, and washes of India ink applied to hot-pressed watercolor paper. Someday I&#8217;d like to work with color, but I don&#8217;t see that happening within this series.<br><br>There you have it&#8211;a little glimpse into my background, the stories I tell, and the pictures I make. I hope it&#8217;s just the beginning and that I will have the opportunity to spend the rest of my life writing books and teaching young people. I can&#8217;t imagine anything better."

It was, for me, a terrible violation of privacy.<br><br>Like so many passionate readers, I decided to try to write a book of my own&ndash;to open one of those magical doors myself.

And those images kept me from giving up.<br><br>The wonderful thing about writing fiction is that you can be inspired by the real world without being limited by its facts. You are allowed to imagine and embellish (particularly when one of your main characters inhabits an invented world of ice). I decided that my story took place in Greenland, where dog sledding is part of everyday life, and suddenly I had a cast of dogs. I discovered that a glacier could conceal a freshwater lake. I read about fireflies and learned that their&#160;light is&#160;triggered by oxygen. A glaciologist told me how to scare a polar bear with a flare gun, and why he loved his bread maker.

Which is sort of akin to the process of being a human being, even if you aren&#8217;t a writer. . . . And seriously, what is writing, other than telling stories about being a human being?&quot;--Daniel Ehrenhaft</i><br><br><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><br><br>If there&#8217;s one thing you can say about Daniel Ehrenhaft&#8211;aside from the fact that he&#8217;s worn the same corduroys for the past eleven years&#8211;it&#8217;s that he has a difficult time writing about himself.  So when Random House asked him to contribute a little autobiography for this Website, he was naturally apprehensive.  <br><br>At first, he decided to do some research on the subject of autobiography.  He referred to this very site to read what other Random House authors had written about themselves.  It didn&#8217;t help.  For starters, he discovered that all these authors led fascinating, productive lives. To make matters worse, they all offered trenchant insight about what it means to be a writer. <br><br>As far as Mr. Ehrenhaft can tell, his own life as a writer boils down to a six-part regimen:<br><br>1) Drinking cheap coffee<br>2) Procrastinating (fiddling with the stereo, playing air guitar, etc.)<br>3) Reading a lot. Often, he&#8217;ll read something brilliant or moving or hilarious by someone he&#8217;s never read before, someone whose words end up blowing his mind&#8211;which is followed by<br>4) Jealousy and panic <br>5) Lunch  <br>6) A nap<br><br>But, in a strange way, this process does eventually inspire him to put pen to paper. (Or his fingertips to the computer keyboard, as it were.) After all, he knows what it&#8217;s like to be scared, and to put things off, and to worry about opening up to perfect strangers.  Which is sort of akin to the process of being a human being, even if you aren&#8217;t a writer. <br><br>And seriously, what <i>is</i> writing, other than telling stories about being a human being?  If that sounds evasive and simplistic&#8230;well, maybe it is.  On the other hand, that&#8217;s probably why a lot of writers do what they do.  They open up in their stories in ways that&#8211;at their best&#8211;illuminate truths and complexities not only about themselves, but about their readers, as well.  They write precisely so they don&#8217;t have to be evasive, which is what makes reading such a blast.  <br><br>So really, Daniel Ehrenhaft just writes because he loves to read, and he aspires to do what all his favorite authors have done for him.  In fact, if he had it his way, he would get <i>paid</i> to read.  Then again, if he had it his way, he and his wife would live in a huge castle with a billiards room and a pool shaped like a figure eight, and a custom-made electric guitar signed by the surviving members of The Clash.  <br><br>Until that happens, though, he&#8217;ll probably keep writing."

Everybody says just what they mean, with few embellishments, regardless of who likes it, or whether it makes sense.<br><br>&#8220;How do you suppose that we ever ended up with a writer in this family?&#8221; my mother asks.<br><br>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; I reply. &#8220;Anyway, I may be something else next year.&#8221; But it makes me wonder what exactly my family has had to do with my being a writer. Here are some things I remember about growing up among them.<br><br>My father and brother are engineers&#8212;they can tell you how anything works. When my brother won the Jermyn (Pennsylvania) Soap Box Derby race on the hill outside our house on Franklin Street, I was sure our family had reached its pinnacle of fame.<br><br>My mother, who acts and speaks without pretense or subtlety, is matter-of-factly brave and has an intuitive mind. You didn&#8217;t dare contemplate doing anything you weren&#8217;t supposed to do when she was around. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you even think about it,&#8221; she&#8217;d say. When I was twelve, Charlie Fron, our school bus driver, told me she was a good mother, and that she could make a whole busload of kids behave by just looking at them. I stood there a moment, breathing in the silage smell of the bus (Charlie kept it in his barn when the weather was cold) and thought my heart would burst with pride.<br><br>My father&#8217;s mother, Mema Fisher, was gentle and lovely&#8212;she knew about color and texture and mood. Her eye was always cocked for a shapely flower, even if it was a weed; her ear was always tuned to the sounds of the woods. She had a chaotic garden that was always in bloom, and I loved going to her sitting room to listen to our favorite songs (which included &#8220;Mockingbird Hill&#8221;) on her record player.<br><br>Mema Brittain, my other grandmother, and my aunt Elaine were compassionate women. They were capable of understanding and forgiving almost everything. Unlike the rest of my tall, large-boned family, they were delicate and feminine. I was a flower girl at Aunt Elaine&#8217;s wedding, and I treasured the weeks of preparation, during which the two of them introduced me to the mysteries of face creams and perfume and silk slips.<br><br>I found out much later why it was that my mother had absolutely nothing (except love) in common with the two of them&#8212;but that&#8217;s another story.<br><br>When I was small, I would float in the bathtub made especially for my very long father and create scenes in my head in which I would be a diva or a famous actress.<br><br>I lived to fish. In the summer, I got up before dawn and climbed into my bathing suit, shorts, and T-shirt. I&#8217;d spend every day on the dock in front of our summerhouse on Chapman Lake with a line in the water, daydreaming about all the exotic places I&#8217;d ever heard of, stopping only when it got hot to jump into the icy water. At night we&#8217;d go out with flashlights to pounce on nightcrawlers for the next day&#8217;s fishing. My sister Karen thought my activities were unspeakable. She and her friends met to paint their nails. (<i>Another </i>story, perhaps.)<br><br>I was a liberal arts major in college, mainly because I couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation to read to my heart&#8217;s content and get credit for it. After graduation I had various jobs, all having something to do with writing and research. Eventually I landed in Hong Kong, where I became a reporter for United Press International. For six years I alternated between being a desk rat and covering the China story, meeting scholars, artists, lawyers, and businessmen who had been inside China, which until 1978 had been closed to Americans for a quarter of a century. I played tennis overlooking the harbor, sailed on the South China Sea, ate Suchow food in the back alleys of the Western District, and sometimes talked until dawn in hotel bars with triad gang members, Chinese Communists, and other questionable characters who would have made my mother&#8217;s hair stand on end. (Yet another story!)<br><br>When UPI offered me my own bureau in South Asia, my mother said, &#8220;Come home. Quit this Mata Hari life and meet a nice man, get married, and have some children.&#8221; But I had friends who were living sensible lives, and they hadn&#8217;t necessarily ended up with love, marriage, and houses full of happy children. So I went to India.<br><br>It&#8217;s been said that revolutions happen in ten-year cycles. In 1989, it was the extraordinary events of Eastern Europe. In 1979, the year I went to India, the revolution in Iran resulted in the taking of American hostages. Here are some of the things that happened that year in the countries my UPI bureau covered: In Pakistan, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged. Islamic fundamentalists burned the American Embassy in Islamabad with ninety people inside. Most of them survived, but six people died. In India, Indira Gandhi presided over the demise of the government of Morarji Desai and returned to power, beginning a period of more violence than at any time since the aftermath of the independence of India and Pakistan from British rule in 1947. Civil war broke out in Afghanistan, two prime ministers were killed in office, and Soviet troops entered the country, to remain for ten bloody years.<br><br>Keeping up with these events resulted in the most adventurous phase of my life to date. I traveled extensively with Mrs. Gandhi as she campaigned. We talked early in the morning over tea and late at night over warm milk. I shot the first photographs of Soviet troops being airlifted into Kabul. In the ranks of soldiers marching across the tarmac at the Kabul airport, one carried a Christmas tree on his shoulders. Fear was as thick as dust in the air. Our Afghan colleagues and friends began to disappear.<br><br>Three years followed in Washington, during which I worked on a part-time basis for <i>The Washington Post</i> and began to write fiction. I returned to Pakistan in 1985 to work under contract to the U.S. Agency for International Development on a study of poor rural women. It was during this time I met an extraordinary girl in the Cholistan Desert, the daughter of a nomadic camel herder, whose story became the basis for <i>Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind</i> and <i>Haveli</i>.<br><br>If there is anything special at all about us odd ducks who write, it is our passion for stories. I used to worry that I&#8217;d run out of stories, but so far I haven&#8217;t. If I ever do, I plan to take up fishing again.<br><br><br><b>PRAISE<br><br></b>HAVELI<br><br>&#8212;A <i>Booklist </i>Editors&#8217; Choice<br>&#8212;An ALA Best Book for Young Adults<br><br>&#8220;Again, Staples imbues Shabanu and her beautiful, repressive world with a splendid reality that transcends the words on the page.&#8221;&#8212;Starred, <i>Kirkus Reviews<br><br></i>&#8220;As freshly inspired as its predecessor.&#8221;&#8212;<i>The Bulletin<br><br></i>&#8220;Page-turning intrigue.&#8221;&#8212;Starred, <i>Booklist<br><br><br></i>SHABANU<br><br>&#8212;A Newbery Honor Winner<br>&#8212;An ALA Notable Children&#8217;s Book<br>&#8212;An ALA Best Book for Young Adults<br>&#8212;A Library of Congress Children&#8217;s Book of the Year<br>&#8212;An IBBY Honor List Book<br>&#8212;A <i>Horn Book</i> Fanfare<br>&#8212;A <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book of the Year<br>&#8212;A Notable Children&#8217;s Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies<br><br>&#8220;One of the most exciting YA books to appear recently. . . .

194,True,Barbara,Barbara Hall,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/11573,Hall,False,"I am a curious creature. In some ways, I am still a small-town Southern woman, only now I live in Los Angeles. I have also spent a great deal of time in England and New York City. I write books and I play in a band and I&#8217;m Catholic. I am also a producer and writer for television. I am a mother and I hang out with surfers and I like motorcycles (though I don&#8217;t drive one) and I turn my music up very loud.<br><br>I like to read. When I came across the quote in which Albert Einstein claimed he was not particularly intelligent, just passionately curious, I was greatly relieved. I no longer had to be eccentric, stubborn, or complicated or have ADD&#8211;I could be passionately curious. If only I had known this when I was a teenager! Back then, I looked a little bit crazy to my family and to the inhabitants of the town where I grew up. I was the youngest of three kids and I didn&#8217;t follow in any of my siblings&#8217; footsteps.<br><br>I did all kinds of things in my quest to have adventures, but I lived in a small town, so my efforts were limited. I taught myself to play the guitar. I stole rides with boys on minibikes. I wrote long letters to local DJs, getting them to play my song requests and to read my thoughts on the air. I wrote poems and sent them off to magazines. I was published at fourteen and again at fifteen, at which time I was also paid ten dollars. It was the beginning of my life as a professional writer. It wasn&#8217;t until after I had moved away from home that I began to understand how growing up in the South had shaped my personality as well as my voice as a writer. <br><br>I had a strong desire to talk about how circumstances are handed down through the generations. It doesn&#8217;t mean that people are doomed by their circumstances. It does mean that people, even young people, have to recognize where and what they come from, and in some instances, they have to do a certain amount of work to overcome it. The South has had to overcome the burden of slavery. It is a problem they brought upon themselves, and there is still a price to be paid. Such a burden often falls on children: we have to clean up the mess our ancestors made, much as young people today will have to help clean up what generations before have done to the environment.<br><br>I believe that few people understand the South very well these days. I have a fifteen-year-old daughter, and I notice how she is taught about it in school. They brush past the Civil War, and no one talks about the South much because no one really cares about the losers. The Civil War was not only about slavery, it was also about state versus federal rights. The South wanted to rule itself badly enough to go to war; that gives you an idea of what a proud society it once was. One important part of history that had a great impact on my ancestors was the era of Reconstruction. That&#8217;s when the North tried to help the South put the pieces back together, but their efforts were not always admirable. It was a terrible period in our history, and people still remember it and talk about it. In <u>The Noah Confessions,</u> I decided to write a little bit about the Reconstruction in an effort to help myself and others understand how it affected my life.<br><br>Everything in the South is gothic. There is a heightened sense of drama carved out of a history of gentility and manners. Southerners turn small things into big ones; at the same time they deal stoically with larger matters. Insults are big on the scale; death is matter of fact. Southerners are not afraid of salt, grease, dirt, germs or alcohol. They are afraid of lawyers, doctors and pills. It still seems like a sound philosophy to me.<br><br>Secrets are big in the South, and they are often confused with privacy, which is how I ended up writing a book on that subject. Secrets create mystery; people who do not like to keep secrets or become the victims of them naturally become detectives in their own lives. Children should never be asked to keep secrets, particularly the secrets of their families.<br><br>Many aspects of my family were shrouded in mystery because the habit of secrecy was passed down over generations. When I would ask about my ancestors my mother would often say, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know much about that side,&#8221; or &#8220;You might want to be careful what you go digging for.&#8221; I don&#8217;t believe my family was aware of being secretive; I think they believed they were being private or minding their own business. The problem came when I, as a passionately curious person, needed to know more than I was allowed. And in some cases, more than I could handle.<br><br>The secrets revealed in <u>Noah</u> are much more dramatic than the ones I uncovered in my own life. But the dynamic is similar. Whenever I was told something that didn&#8217;t add up, getting to the truth became a dangerous mission that threatened my position in the family. Going a step further and talking about it granted me black sheep status from time to time. But there was no way to fully understand myself or my experience without knowing the history leading up to me. This is why I spent a lot of time later in life wading through both the story of my family and the story of the town I grew up in.<br><br>Much of the history of the South became lost or distorted because of the Civil War. During Reconstruction, the real secrets began. People had to hide things so that they wouldn&#8217;t be taken or stolen. Confederate money was worthless, so other valuables had to be buried. Property had to be disguised. In many cases, entire families were turned out on the streets, having lost everything to the war. And sometimes, oftentimes, people had to resort to illegal activities to survive. Bootlegging, smuggling, black market schemes, secret societies. Eventually the South regained its respectability by rebuilding proper industries. But for a while, for many families, the only way to survive was to live outside the rules.<br><br>The tradition of not airing your dirty laundry, or any other kind, was born from that particular time in history. If you look back far enough in almost any Southern family, you are going to find the black sheep who resorted to activities no one wants to discuss.<br><br>In <u>The Noah Confessions,</u> I wanted to write about a girl who is harboring an enormous secret and how that has stopped her from having a normal life. In this case, she&#8217;s afraid it will prevent her from ever being free or happy. She knows that her devotion to the truth has the power to alienate her from her entire family. She also knows it is her only salvation. I have always been interested in writing about teenagers who have to face choices like that. Even in <u>Joan of Arcadia,</u> I chose to write about a teenager with a mission so big that most adults couldn&#8217;t handle it.<br><br>I wanted to show the connections from one generation to the next and to validate the coming-of-age struggle, which is a struggle to understand your immediate environment and, at the same time, to put yourself in some kind of historical context. I believe it is the best way to discover your purpose&#8211;which is the most fascinating and worthwhile journey you can ever take. It is the song that never ends.<br><br>But what a song. Turn it up loud."

270,True,Kate,Kate Klimo,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/15932,Klimo,False,"<b>Tales of a Fourth Grade Fantasy Writer<br></b>It all began in the fourth grade when my best friend, Justine and I--inspired by <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, <i>Curdie and the Princess</i>, <i>The Wonderful Journey to the Mushroom Planet</i>, the books of E. Nesbit (and countless other works of fantasy recommended to us by our imperious rouge-cheeked librarian, Mrs. Thackeray)--embarked upon a fantasy epic of our own. We wrote our epic in multi-colored inks (Justine had gotten this nifty set of colored plastic quills for her birthday) in a series of classic black and white composition notebooks, whose white spaces we colored in so that every time we touched them, we got rainbows on our fingertips. I can&#8217;t remember the plot but I do know that it featured a cast of unicorns, elves, fairies, and an evil magician whose name, Pezlar, was inspired by our favorite candy. Our characters lived on islands that were shaped in their own likenesses; for instance, the unicorns lived on an island shaped like a unicorn head, where there was, naturally, a Cape Horn and a Beard Bay. Whenever we had writer&#8217;s block, we simply drew maps. We were writing (and drawing), not so much for posterity as to conjure a world that, we fervently hoped, would one day open its magical portals and take us in. The world shimmered with latent magic and we lived our days in a state of heightened expectation. When would the magic reveal itself?<b><br><br>Those Magical Oldsters<br></b>Taking our cue from the Professor in the Narnia books, Mary Poppins, and Mrs. Pigglewiggle, old people were especially magical to us. Ike Raff, the grumpy old man who owned the cigar store; Charlie Hicks, the seven-foot-tall homeless man who marched in the Memorial Day parade in a full Cherokee regalia, and even the scary Mrs. Thackeray were, we suspected, distinguished emissaries from magical lands. To their credit, they played it straight when, with burning intensity, we asked them such questions as, &#8220;Where do you really come from?&#8221; and &#8220;How did you get here?&#8221; &#8220;Did you fly, teleport, or use a traveling spell?&#8221; <br><br><b>Step right up to the Museum of Magic<br></b>Magical talismans were vitally important to us. We collected beach glass, horse chestnuts, antique buttons, old coins, and even a green crystal doorknob. And, yes, we had our own Museum of Magic that we set up in Justine&#8217;s side yard, which was just across the street from the beach. I say we set it up. I&#8217;m not sure we ever had any paying customers. We were raising funds so that we could buy the fabric to make long hunter-green capes with hoods. These were the outfits we planned to wear when we passed through the magical portals.  We must have raised the funds somehow, because we actually stitched up the capes on my mother&#8217;s sewing machine. How proud we were of them! So you can imagine how crushed we were when we wore them into town one day and somebody asked us which 4-H troupe we belonged to. <br><br><b>Magical Portals<br></b>We looked everywhere for them: Mr. Raff&#8217;s cigar store (where we would later buy our Beatles fan mags), an old wooden boat house down at the beach, an abandoned rococo-baroque Victorian mansion near my house just bristling with magical possibilities.<br>One Friday night, before our favorite TV show, <i>Twilight Zone, </i>came on at 9:30, we took a candle and some matches and made a pilgrimage to the Victorian mansion. It was a cold and windy night, I recall, and when we spied a broken window off the porch, it seemed to say to us, &#8220;Trespass, please!&#8221; With lit candle, we solemnly walked from room to room, searching for the portal. When we got to the third floor landing, the candle suddenly flared up and then guttered. We screamed and tore out of that place back to my mother&#8217;s warm, safe kitchen. Magic, we concluded, was sometimes a pretty scary proposition. We steeled ourselves and determined to make a return trip to the ruined mansion. We never managed that second trip because a wrecker ball rolled in and leveled the site of our closest brush with magic. A branch of the U.S. Post Office took its place and, although we never attempted to break in (Federal Offense!), we did loiter in the foyer, searching for magical signs among the Wanted Posters and the public notices. <br><br><b>Adolescence Rears Its Ugly Head<br></b>Looking back on those years, I see that, for us, magic was a kind of pagan belief system. It was both an affirmation of and an escape from life. But maintaining our belief system was not always easy. It was often downright burdensome. We had our rituals to observe, and our obligations, too. (We held weekly classes for our stuffed animals in the faerie arts, complete with lesson plans and demonstration models). Our beliefs isolated us from the other kids (who already suspected we were more than a little bit tetched). There came a time when a kind of low-grade dread began to steal over us; dread of the day when, like Susan Pevense, we would wake up and want to wear lipstick and stockings. And of course, that day did dawn, slowly enough to be agonizing. It started with the Beatles. We simply redirected all that magical intensity in the direction of the Fab 4. Instead of believing in portals, we believed we would one day not only get to meet them, but get to marry them (Justine, John; me, Paul). After that, it was a just small step to wearing lipstick (well, Mary Quant lip gloss, in any case), stockings (fish net), mini skirts (tweed and veddy British) and, before we knew it, we were looking back on our days of magic with patronizing fondness. <br><br><b>Reader, I Wrote<br></b>When I grew up, I still wanted to write but writing for children seemed, well, childish. I determined to be a writer of Adult Books, and succeeded (on a very modest level). But what can I tell you? The lack of magic in the adult world, as much from a reader&#8217;s standpoint as a writer&#8217;s, eventually got to me. I missed the magic, and years later, here I am, drawn back to its portals. I even find myself believing again. I believe that the world in which we live, the world of consensus reality, is but one small room in a mansion full of rooms. I believe that writing and reading are two surefire ways to get access to the other rooms. And nowadays, it is my sole ambition to grow up to be one of those old people who just might be mistaken for a distinguished emissary from a magical land. <br>Do I fly, teleport, or cast traveling spells? <br>The answer to all of the above is yes!"

It is, according to David Halberstam, &ldquo;Surely the greatest book ever written about a city.&rdquo; And <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> said: &ldquo;In the future, the scholar who writes the history of American cities in the twentieth century will doubtless begin with this extraordinary effort.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> The first volume of The Years of Lyndon Johnson, <i>The Path to Power, </i>was cited by <i>The Washington Post</i> as &ldquo;proof that we live in a great age of biography . . . [a book] of radiant excellence . . . Caro&rsquo;s evocation of the Texas Hill Country, his elaboration of Johnson&rsquo;s unsleeping ambition, his understanding of how politics actually work, are let it be said flat out&mdash;at the summit of American historical writing.&rdquo; Professor Henry F. Graff of Columbia University called the second volume, <i>Means of Ascent, </i>&ldquo;brilliant. No review does justice to the drama of the story Caro is telling, which is nothing less than how present-day politics was born.&rdquo; <i>The London Times</i> hailed volume three, <i>Master of the Senate,</i> as &ldquo;a masterpiece . . . Robert Caro has written one of the truly great political biographies of the modern age.&rdquo; <i>The Passage of Power, </i>volume four, has been called &ldquo;Shakespearean . . . A breathtakingly dramatic story [told] with consummate artistry and ardor&rdquo; (<i>The New York Times</i>) and &ldquo;as absorbing as a political thriller . . . By writing the best presidential biography the country has ever seen, Caro has forever changed the way we think about, and read, American history&rdquo; (NPR). On the cover of <i>The New York Times Book Review, </i>President Bill Clinton praised it as &ldquo;Brilliant . . . Important . . . Remarkable. With this fascinating and meticulous account Robert Caro has once again done America a great service."" In his newest book, <i>Working, </i>Caro gives us an unprecedented glimpse into his own life and work, in evocatively written, personal pieces.<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Caro has a unique place among American political biographers,&rdquo; <i>The Boston Globe</i> said. &ldquo;He has become, in many ways, the standard by which his fellows are measured.&rdquo; And Nicholas von Hoffman wrote: &ldquo;Caro has changed the art of political biography.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> Born and raised in New York City, Caro graduated from Princeton University, was later a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, and worked for six years as an investigative reporter for <i>Newsday.</i> He lives with his wife, the writer Ina Caro, in New York City, where he is at work on the fifth and final volume of The Years of Lyndon Johnson."

When the story first appeared in 1996 on the website of the&#160;<i>San Jose Mercury News</i>, it became an unprecedented internet sensation, receiving up to 1.3 million hits daily. The report was the target of a famously vicious media backlash that ended his career as a mainstream journalist. When Webb told the whole story in the book&#160;<i>Dark Alliance</i>, some of the same publications that had vilified him retracted their criticism and praised his courage in telling the truth about one of the worst official abuses in our nation&rsquo;s history. Others, including his own former newspaper and the&#160;<i>New York Times</i>, continued to treat him as an outlaw. Before joining the&#160;<i>Mercury News</i>, Webb cut his journalism teeth at the&#160;<i>Kentucky Post</i>&#160;and&#160;<i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i>.

294,True,Amber,Amber Kizer,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/73191,Kizer,False,"Have you ever played a game called Three Truths? Basically, it&#8217;s like a multiple choice test except you have four choices and one of them is a total lie&#8211;the others are true&#8230;The point of the game is to figure out which one is a total lie . . . what&#8217;s that? You wish you could play right now? Well, goody because I think that&#8217;s much more fun than a dry bio&#8211;plus you could win big prizes (that&#8217;s a lie), but you&#8217;ll have the invigorating experience of being right. And really when it comes down to it, how can a new car beat being right? <br><br>We&#8217;ll start off easy to get you warmed up. First set: 1) Amber Kizer is my real name; 2) I live on an island; 3) I have a rooster named Fabio; 4) I have parakeets named Chirp and Pecker<br><br>Think you know which one is false? Say it out loud, no cheating! Ready? I do not have a penname, which means Amber Kizer is, in fact, my real name (although, I have considered writing under the name J.K. Rowling, just because it has such a catchy ring to it). I do live on an island. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not a gorgeous tropical island. It&#8217;s in the Pacific Northwest where gray skies and green trees (thanks to the rain!) are the most popular colors. I do have a rooster named Fabio. He is named after a very famous cover model for romance novels&#8211;the human Fabio is beefy, doesn&#8217;t own t-shirts, and has long blond hair he swings around seductively. The chicken Fabio isn&#8217;t beefy (tastes like chicken), doesn&#8217;t own t-shirts, and has long blond feathers, which he does indeed throw around like he&#8217;s in front of a wind machine. I do not have parakeets because I don&#8217;t like cages and in my mind having parakeets is one step away from wearing housecoats, lycra in public, and owning 50 cats, all named Sweetie. <br><br>It&#8217;s going to get harder . . . 1) I make wedding cakes for fun; 2) I love reality TV&#8211;especially dating shows; 3) I have four kids and am married; 4) I don&#8217;t miss a minute of March Madness basketball if I can help it.<br><br>Think you know? I do make wedding cakes for fun, and birthday cakes, and I love you cakes, and cakes of all kinds. I love to bake. If you want to see photos of cakes I&#8217;ve made just visit my Web site at AmberKizer.com. I do love reality TV&#8211;and especially dating shows, the raunchier it is, the funnier and the better it is. Please don&#8217;t hold this against me, I&#8217;m in therapy to break the addiction! I adore college hoops and try not to miss any of the tournaments&#8211;men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s. I&#8217;m not married and don&#8217;t have kids&#8211;I&#8217;m young and, while I do hope those things are in my future somewhere way down the line, they&#8217;re on the wish list rather than in the cart. I am, however, in stock and ready to ship. <br><br>All right, I&#8217;m done being nice to you. Here&#8217;s a hard one: 1) I read 15&#8212;20 books concurrently; 2) I quilt; 3) Roses are my favorite flower; 4) I collect amber jewelry when I travel.<br><br>I do read a huge, high stack of books all at the same time&#8211;it keeps it interesting. There&#8217;s too much to learn in the world to read one from start to finish. So I read a chapter, change books, read a chapter and so on, until whatever I&#8217;m reading is so compelling I have to finish the book. Pretty much any topic is game, but I stay away from math theory and computer programming because they just give me a headache. I do quilt&#8211;I love working with colors and fabrics. I don&#8217;t quilt as often as I&#8217;d like because these hands are usually wrung dry from typing, but yum, it feeds my creative soul to stitch fabrics together. Roses are a favorite, but my ultimate favorite flowers are lilies&#8211;Casablanca white ones, Stargazer pinks, any of the really fragrant lilies&#8211;the scent makes my soul smile. So that was kinda a trick one because, of course, I collect amber jewelry. I love it and it looks good with my coloring, so it&#8217;s a win win. <br><br>Now, to the super-duper difficult ones: 1) I&#8217;ve wanted to be a writer since I could talk; 2) I wrote my first book at the age of five called &#8220;Wiggle Me, Tiggle Me&#8221;; 3) I only write when my muse taps me on the shoulder; 4) I don&#8217;t have to do much editing; it&#8217;s usually close to perfect the first time around.<br><br>Think you know? Ha ha, changed it up&#8211;they&#8217;re all LIES! LIES, LIES, LIES! Okay, so maybe that wasn&#8217;t fair, but it was fun. I always wanted to be a criminal prosecuting attorney and eventually a Supreme Court Justice. (Can you spell <i>overachiever</i> anyone?) But I played basketball fervently, and over the course of high school, I ended up with some fairly nasty injuries to my feet and legs. Those led to surgeries, which then gave room to a rare nerve disorder. I developed symptoms at age 18 and it totally and completely sucks (just telling it like it is). In the simplest of terms, the system that controls pain signals, temperature, circulation, and all that very important stuff is corrupted to the point that it&#8217;s wrong all the time&#8211;which means my legs hurt all the time and don&#8217;t always work for me when I ask them to. So this means my life has to be fairly fluid&#8211;I can not tell you how many plans I&#8217;ve had to cancel, how many shows I&#8217;ve given away tickets to, how many great ideas I&#8217;ve had to say &#8220;sorry&#8221; to. I know someone loves me when I say I&#8217;m hurting and they show up with ice cream and a video when we were supposed to go out. This also means that I can&#8217;t count on my legs to have a structured 9 to 5 job (although I&#8217;d love to do any number of things on a consistent basis), so I had to figure out a career that was flexible and that I could do on the good days, or from a horizontal position on the bad ones. A friend invited me to a workshop she was giving on how to teach writing to kids. I did all the activities, and I was hooked on storytelling. I came away from that six weeks with six pages of a story. I wanted to know the ending, so I kept writing. <br><br>Oh, and I should probably tell you that I started in adult romances. Yes, that&#8217;s right, I <i>love</i> romances and they&#8217;re completely a hoot to write&#8211;a hopeless romantic, I adore happy endings and who doesn&#8217;t like hot, steamy, monkey s---socks. Monkey socks.  So I wrote one book, then another, then another. The whole time I was learning what I could about the craft&#8211;it&#8217;s like wanting to be a great artist you need to know the techniques and tools of the craft, and you have to practice. I also spent a great deal of time learning the business end of things&#8211;how agents work, how publishing works, what to expect, what to do right, and what to avoid doing at all costs. There&#8217;s so much to learn I&#8217;m convinced I will never know it all. But I worked my way up the scale from form letter rejections to handwritten notes to long, involved letters asking for revisions. <br><br>I was working on my fourth romance when a voice in my head started giving editorial input. &#8220;He put his hand where? That so wouldn&#8217;t happen . . . eeewww.&#8221; And on and on. Meet Gert. She had things to say and I desperately needed her to shut up, so I opened a new word document and went at it. I figured I&#8217;d let her go until she ran out of steam and then I could get back to the real writing. I guessed 20 pages tops before she ran out of things to say. That was 2005 and she&#8217;s still going. Nothing is off limits, she talks about everything&#8211;even the stuff parents hope their kids don&#8217;t know about. <i>One Butt Cheek</i> is the first in her series&#8211;the second <i>From Butt to Booty</i> comes out next fall.<br><br>I always edit. I always rewrite. And there are no such things as <i>muses</i> unless you use that as a synonym for <i>discipline</i> or <i>perseverance</i>. <br><br>My advice for anyone who thinks they want to be a writer is to hang glide. No, again that&#8217;s not the truth, but it sounds way more interesting than the truth, which is to . . . um . . . write. Also get good at surviving rejection because you have to. Because you have to put yourself out there all the time and learn how to shake it off and do it all over again the next day. You won&#8217;t get published if you don&#8217;t send it out. And you won&#8217;t get published if you send out crap that you haven&#8217;t perfected to the best of your ability. But it&#8217;s not easy, it&#8217;s not pain free and it&#8217;s not for the weak of spirit. It&#8217;s hard, competitive, and everyone thinks because they type out e-mails that writing a book can&#8217;t be much harder than that. Oh yeah, everyone thinks they could write the next bestseller without breaking a sweat, everyone thinks they&#8217;re a writer&#8211;just know that up front. <br><br>So here&#8217;s my advice&#8211;it&#8217;s really good practice to ask the cute boy out, call the girl who you&#8217;ve been crushing on since sixth grade, make yourself available and vulnerable. Because here&#8217;s the deal, they might say yes, they might have been enamored of you for ages, too. Because you could get the call that says, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a contract offer on your book!&#8221; Or at the very least you&#8217;ll have some soul-wrenching real-life experience to write about and that, my friends, is the truth and nothing but the truth. So help me Gert."

Matthews is the winner of the Fidler Award for her book<i> Fish</i>, an award given for a first novel for children. She lives and writes in England.<b><i><br></i><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><i><br>How I write:<br></i></b>When I wrote <i>Fish</i>, it was based on a dream I had. I woke up and thought (as you would, if you had a dream like &#8220;Fish&#8221;), what was all <i>that</i> about? I thought about it, and it seemed to start making a kind of sense. I think I had to put the events in order, as parts of the story appeared in flashback sequence in the dream. I am not sure, but I think I continued to dream other parts of the story later.<br><br>There is no sensible time, as an adult with responsibilities, to sit about writing stories, but I wrote <i>Fish</i> at a particularly silly time. I had two children, knew I had to sell my house, but had no idea where we were going to live, or how we could afford it - I had just walked away from three terms of strenuous teacher training.<br><br>With all these pressures on me, I watched news footage of determined and courageous refugees on television, and went off to bed, worrying about, of <i>all </i>things, how I would transport the three Koi Carp from our pond without distressing them, and to where?<br><br>All my writing seems to happen like this - it works from dreams; in the daytime, I correct and alter and move it around in my head till it seems to make sense; I don&#8217;t write anything down; and by the time I come to write, I know it pretty well and have got rid of all the worst mistakes. Because it&#8217;s hard to keep a whole book in your head and keep running through it to make sure you don&#8217;t forget, I&#8217;m very keen to get it down. I touch type (I was forced to learn how in my first job) so, having worked on a book in my head for maybe six months, I can have the first draft out in two to four weeks, because I am just typing out a story I have already written. I like to do this outside as much as possible, otherwise I get miserable from being inside too much. With <i>Fish</i>, I typed for 12 hours a day sometimes, in this very brief period; I calmed down a little with my second book. <br><br>I like to work like this because when it&#8217;s in your head it is easy to just rip out a chapter or move something to a different part of the story - no retyping time and time again!<br>When I was a child and had scary dreams, I learned to manipulate them, to control the events. I think this plays a part in the way my dreams form the stories to my books.<br><br><b><i>Where do you get your ideas for characters, settings, events? </i><br></b>All of my characters have different parts of my personality in them, I suppose, and parts of people I have known.<br><br>Events - well, I have never battled through a war-torn zone, but I came across a body when I was ten or so, and therefore I could write about Tiger&#8217;s feelings, sitting by the body of the young man who was shot.<br><br>I grew up the youngest of a family of five children; both of our parents worked full time and the house had a long garden which backed onto a wild area of land . . . much of my time was spent scrambling about, making camps, coming home filthy and scratched, but happy. I had two older brothers and singularly failed to notice that girls should be different until people started telling me so at about the age of 12. I had already noticed something was up when I was sent to our local school at 7, and didn&#8217;t get to play cricket and football like at home, but was pushed into a collection of people who played netball and rounders . . . hence the issue - or lack of it! - of Tiger&#8217;s gender in Fish. Some people still don&#8217;t get it. They say, &#8220;I thought it was a girl/boy&#8221; and then ask, &#8220;Well, which was it then? What was Tiger supposed to be?&#8221;<br><br>I answer: &#8220;Tiger&#8217;s not <i>supposed </i>to be anything.&#8221;<br><br>Then they say, &#8220;Yes, but what did you write it as? Girl or boy?&#8221; Just as they are sure there is an answer, I am equally fascinated by the fact they think it matters.<br><br><b><i>Animals (including fish and  birds) are important in my books because:<br></i></b>They may appear in the story at a moment which makes them symbolic, but they&#8217;re real too.<br><br>I communicated with animals probably before I could walk or talk; they were just different kinds of &#8220;peoples&#8221; to me then. I am more likely to notice a small bird hidden in a hedge than a human passing in full view and I still find it hard sometimes to concentrate on a human conversation when an animal is talking at the same time.<br><br><b><i>What motivates me to write?<br></i></b>It gets things out of my system, things that I am cross about, and maybe I can&#8217;t put everything right, but I can say to the world, &#8220;What about this? This is not good enough.&#8221; And to readers who may not have been fully aware: &#8220;This is reality, I know you&#8217;d rather think it has nothing to do with you.&#8221; But at the same time I can show the inspirational qualities of people . . . I am angry at what they are put through, but their courage and determination is something to admire, and only tends to be shown when tested to the limit. It puts my own worries, and my own abilities to cope, in proportion. I wouldn&#8217;t write a book which didn&#8217;t challenge the reader with questions which maybe aren&#8217;t easily answered. I have to write books which at least have the <i>potential</i> to effect changes . . ."

Lewis. <br><br>When my parents were killed in a road accident when I was 14, I searched for books that would relate to how I was feeling, but none of the grief books talked about the weird emotions and thoughts I was having. None of them spoke about the horror, the terror, the waking nightmare I was living. Terrible visions filled my head and I thought I was going crazy. I read about the &#8220;five stages of grief&#8221; and was angry and confused . . . &#8220;Why are my stages so different, so jumbled?&#8221;<br><br>As a result I felt completely alone. <br><br>Before the accident I always imagined myself doing something creative when I &#8220;grew up.&#8221; I just wasn&#8217;t sure what it would be. So, years later, I tried it all! I joined a theater company and became an actress, worked as a newspaper journalist, traveled the world, studied fashion design and started my own label, moved to America and worked in the fashion industry for Versace and other designers, worked on magazine photo shoots with Hollywood celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Jim Carey, Jennifer Aniston, and Hilary Duff, and ran bookstore events for authors including Meg Cabot, Dav Pilkey, Ellen DeGeneres, and the Osbournes. <br><br>So many careers, so many adventures . . . but something was missing. <br><br>There was something inside of me that I needed to express. I just didn&#8217;t know how. <br>Then one day I started to remember things from my childhood&#8211;the happy time before the accident. Scared that I would lose the memories again, I started writing them down. Before I knew it, I was writing a book about my life.<br><br>I never imagined I would write a book, let alone one about my parents&#8217; deaths. I was crazy about books growing up (see my list below), but I thought only people with other- worldly powers actually wrote them, not people like you and me!<br><br>But I figured I&#8217;d give it a try. <br><br>I decided to write <i>Grief Girl</i> in my 14&#8212;18 year old voice, so when you read it you feel like you&#8217;re there with me. That was the hardest part, because in order to do that I had to relive everything I went through&#8211;the night of my parents&#8217; accident, the funerals, going back to school, and just trying to get on with my life. Day after day I would sit at my computer, take myself back in time, and type without pausing, until a story was finished.<br><br><br>People always ask me what was it like to write about something so sad. Well, it was much harder than I thought. <br><br>Dredging up those memories was painful. Some days I would sit at my computer and cry and other days I would be so exhausted I would be only able to write for 15 minutes at a time. <br><br>So what kept me going? The thought that one day someone might read my book and feel less alone, or see that it&#8217;s possible to come through something terrible in your life. <br>Writing <i>Grief Girl</i> was difficult, but it was worth it. <br><br>You know, given the chance I wouldn&#8217;t change the past. It has made me who I am. <br><br>And who am I? I&#8217;m a person who knows from experience that life is precious. It can be over in an instant, so you&#8217;ve got to make the most of it. <br><br>My motto is: It&#8217;s not what happens to you, but what you do with it. <br><br>So, if you&#8217;re reading this, just go for it! Follow your dreams, because anything is possible!<br><br>The books that have inspired me: <br><i>The Bell Jar</i> by Sylvia Plath, <i>The Diary of a Young Girl</i> by Anne Frank, <i>The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole</i> by Sue Townsend, <i>The Color Purple</i> by Alice Walker.

409,True,Rudy,Rudy Wiebe,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/33129,Wiebe,False,"Rudy Wiebe was born on October 4, 1934, in an isolated farm community of about 250 people in a rugged but lovely region near Fairholme, Saskatchewan. His parents had escaped Soviet Russia with five children in 1930, part of the last generation of homesteaders to settle the Canadian West, and part of a Mennonite history of displacement and emigration through Europe and Asia to North and South America since the seventeenth century. In 1947 his family gave up their bush farm and moved to Coaldale, Alberta, a town east of Lethbridge peopled largely by Ukrainians, Mennonites, Mormons, and Central Europeans, as well as Japanese, who ended up there during WW II.<br><br>Rudy Wiebe read as much as possible from an early age; his first reading materials were the Bible, the Eaton's catalogue and the <i>Free Press Weekly Prairie Farmer</i>; he also recalls listening to his parents&#8217; stories of Russia. By Grade 4, he had read through the two shelves of books available in the one-room schoolhouse. Growing up, he enjoyed <b>Les Miserables, Toilers of the Sea, David Copperfield, Tom Brown's Schooldays</b>, Greek myths and Norse legends. Later an admirer of Faulkner, M&#225;rquez, Borges and Tolstoy, Wiebe has always held to the fundamentals of plot, character and, above all, story. He believes stories should begin in the specific and local but expand into &#8220;a human truth larger than any individual.&#8221;<br><br>Wiebe won his first prize for fiction while studying literature at the University of Alberta, where he enrolled in a writing class and began producing poems, plays and stories. His winning story in a Canada-wide contest recounted a young boy&#8217;s response to the death of his sister &#8211; based on Wiebe&#8217;s own experience &#8211; and was published in the magazine <i>Liberty</i> in 1956. After earning his B.A., Wiebe left for the ancient University of T&#252;bingen in West Germany on a Rotary Fellowship to study literature and theology, an experience that increased his respect for older and richer communities. Tena Isaak of British Columbia joined him there and they were married. The couple travelled in England, Austria, Switzerland and Italy before returning to Edmonton, where Wiebe completed his M.A. in creative writing. His thesis grew into his first novel, <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b>. <br><br>In 1962 Wiebe earned a Bachelor of Theology degree from the Mennonite Brethren Bible College; he considered becoming a minister. He was editor of Winnipeg&#8217;s <i>Mennonite Brethren Herald</i> when <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b><i> </i>was published. Many conservative ministers and Mennonites in small towns objected to the novel's frank and at times unflattering portrait of community life, and there was considerable opposition to the book. &#8220;I wasn't exactly sacked as editor . . . but the committee came to me and said &#8216;Ahem.&#8217; I resigned.&#8221; The strength of this reaction made him think hard about the power of the written word, and reinforced his sense of wanting to be a writer.<br><br>Wiebe then was invited to teach at a Mennonite college in Goshen, an agricultural town in Indiana with a large Mennonite and Amish population, where he would be Assistant Professor of English from 1963 to 1967. Goshen College was a lively and stimulating intellectual community where Wiebe committed himself to writing, study, teaching and travel. &#8220;I encountered men and women of real perception . . . really literate Christians who saw themselves as Jesus's followers and at the same time were acquainted with the thoughts of others and had brought that kind of understanding to bear on what it means to be a Christian. The best thing that ever happened to me was the meetings we had every two or three weeks in one home or another &#8211; seven or eight of us, a psychiatrist, a couple of theologians, a couple of literary people. There were the best theologians there, I think, the Mennonite Church has ever had.&#8221; <br><br>Wiebe published his second novel, <b>First and Vital Candle</b>, and began to explore the western United States and the Mennonite settlements in Paraguay. He returned to Edmonton as a professor in creative writing and English at the University of Alberta, and immersed himself in Canadian literature. He wrote reviews, essays and articles, edited anthologies and was soon established as a major figure in Canadian letters. In 1973, his novel <b>The Temptations of Big Bear</b> won a Governor General's Award. Since then he has continued to win the highest praise for his books of fiction and non-fiction. He has written numerous film and television scripts, lectured internationally from Denmark to India, and given readings from Adelaide to Puerto Rico to Helsinki and Igloolik. For thirty years he taught literature and creative writing at colleges and universities in Canada, the United States and Germany. Now retired from teaching, his former students include such accomplished writers as Myrna Kostash, Aritha van Herk, Thomas Wharton and Katherine Govier.<br>  <br>Wiebe was called the first major Mennonite writer to place his community&#8217;s experience in a broader framework. Mennonites assert the fundamental authority of Scripture, especially the New Testament, as a practical guide to life. But while Wiebe imbues his work with a deep moral seriousness, his focus has always been on narrative. &#8220;I never consciously think of writing a so-called Christian novel. I don&#8217;t think Albert Camus ever thought of writing an existentialist novel, either. I think of getting at, of building, a story.&#8221; As a prairie writer, he has often concerned himself with Native stories, feeling place of birth to be more important than blood ancestry. &#8220;Those Mennonite villages in Russia are my heritage, but not my world. The world I feel and sense in my bones is the bush of northern Saskatchewan, of prairie Canada.&#8221; Native spirituality, with its vital links to the physical world, has always attracted him. But his fiction manages to transcend nationality and locale to explore the struggles of communities and individuals; his books and stories have been translated into nine European languages, as well as Chinese, Japanese and Hindi.<br><br>Whatever Wiebe&#8217;s focus in a given work, he has always chosen ambitious themes, and his work rewards readers with an intensity seldom rivalled. He is a voice of Canadian fiction that cannot be ignored, and whose work promises to endure."

In them, fat people don&#8217;t necessarily transform into thin ones, nor do snaggle-toothed computer nerds become prom queens&#8212;although sometimes they do because we all love that kind of thing. What interests me most, though, is change within one&#8217;s self. <br><br><i>Dark</i>, <i>quirky</i>, and <i>magical</i> are words used to describe my work. I&#8217;m a fan of those things. You need dark to distinguish light, and magic to find the edges of science. Even very young children love to snuggle in their cozy, well-lit bedrooms and enter the dark, spooky forests of a fairy tale. We have a taste for the gothic, although none of us want to be trapped in grim situations ourselves. When that does happen, it&#8217;s the brave or hilarious or unpredictable way we deal with it that defines who we are. For example, in <i>Sights</i>, displaced Baby Girl finally gives up trying to fit in and devotes herself to playing the accordion with her odd little band. The things that set her apart from her peers go on to transform her, and she regains the feisty confidence she was born with. <br><br>I think we all start out optimistic and ready to rock and roll. Things happen that change that. A single traumatic incident with school, friends, or family can shrivel the innocent self-satisfaction of early childhood. In <i>Deep</i>, sad, powerful Morgan sails away from her broken family but remains enshrouded by the past: her past is a constant mist that blurs the way she sees the world. Freedom from that mist comes to her through a spirited little girl who opens Morgan to viewing herself, and her family, in a different way.<br><br>Such change is possible. As a child, I daydreamed my way through years of school. Eager as I was to please my teachers, I was unable to control the cinematic, thrill-packed fantasies that overlaid the diagrams on the blackboard.<br><br>It wasn&#8217;t until young adulthood that it occurred to me that the antic daydreams&#8212;my demise!&#8211;&#8211;were stories competing to get <i>out</i>. Allowing characters to come forth, writing down their stories, turned out to be okay with everyone. All I had to do was improve my skills to get the stories properly written. I became a writer, and that changed everything. <br><br>I never became a thin, perfect-toothed prom queen, but I remain optimistic and ready to rock and roll. <br><br>Good luck to us all! <br><br><br>Susanna Vance<br><br><br><i>Learn more at <b>SusannaVance.com </b><br></i><br><br><b>PRAISE</b><br><br>SIGHTS<br><br>&#8212;An ALA Best Book for Young Adults<br>&#8212;A YALSA Best Books for Young Adults<br>&#8212;A <i>Publishers Weekly </i>Flying Start Author<i><br></i><br>&#8220;This commanding debut novel of eccentric outsiders shaking things up in a small town features a narrative voice of startling originality.&#8221;&#8212;Starred<i>, Publishers Weekly<br></i><br>&#8220;This unsual novel . . . contains a striking combination of tragedy and whimsy.&#8221;&#8212;Starred<i>, The Horn Book Magazine</i>"

One day, my parents were watching the news on TV and saw black and white students being beaten for riding the bus together. When my parents saw this they knew right away that it was time for them to go back to the South and fight for civil rights for all. I was not even a year old when we moved to Atlanta, Georgia.&#160;<br><br>What I remember most about growing up in Atlanta was that our house was always full of people. During the civil rights movement, there would be people sleeping on our floor, meeting in our living room, and eating at our table. Later, when my dad ran for Congress, it was more of the same. I always had many aunts and uncles that were not related to us at all, but part of our family, nevertheless.<br><br>I&#160;went to a private school for the first couple of years of my education, one that my oldest sister, Andrea, integrated. When she graduated, she recommended that Lisa and I leave, too. It had not been a pleasant experience for her and she wanted to spare us the pain. I continued in public schools until my dad became the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and we moved to New York again, where I finished high school at the United Nations School. Then, it was back to the South, to Duke University, for college. After that I headed to Uganda to try teaching. I loved it! I returned to New York one more time to get my master&rsquo;s degree in Education at Bank Street College.<br>&#160;<br>I started teaching in Atlanta public schools, and one summer I went to Washington, D.C., to work for the National Black Child Development Institute. I met the love of my life, Hilary Shelton, who impressed me with his passion for justice. I married him one year later. We have three amazing, creative, energetic sons&mdash;Caleb, Joshua, and Noah&mdash;who keep us very busy and quite entertained.&#160;<br><br>I always loved to write. I would write volumes of poetry, keep a diary, record my dreams, and write long letters, short stories, and even a television show. I wrote my first children&rsquo;s book as my master&rsquo;s thesis. My cousin illustrated it and I sent it out to countless publishers, and received countless rejections. I kept writing. My current work-in-progress features three amazing boys who bear a striking resemblance to my own sons.<br><br>As a first-grade teacher, I get to read a lot of children&rsquo;s books and I also enjoy storytelling. I began telling stories about the civil rights movement to our students, and one day a parent, who happened to be a published author, heard me and said, ""You should write this down.""

His artwork has been featured in various exhibitions and permanent collections throughout the country.<br><br><br><b>Books</b> <br>I usually start with a picture, and then the words and story line follow. I was a visual artist first, so this seems natural. <br><br>I make books I want to see but haven&#8217;t been made yet. <br><br>I make books for myself&#8212;it&#8217;s the audience I understand most&#8212;and I&#8217;m blessed that children seem to like what I do. <br><br>I&#8217;m interested in what books do that other art forms don&#8217;t&#8212;that is, they involve the element of time. Time passes as the reader turns the pages, revealing events in a sequence&#8212;a story. <br>My paintings have always been narratives, and the natural next step was books.<br><br><b>Ideas</b> <br>Ideas come from anywhere and everywhere. Because of this, everything I do has a chance of influencing my work. Experiences + reaction to those experiences = ideas. <br><br>My favorite part of the bookmaking process is the beginning: exploration, discovery, sketching, daydreaming. <br><br>I make many preliminary sketches. I need to get an idea down on paper so I can step away and literally see it. The novelist E. M. Forster wrote, &#8220;How do I know what I think until I see what I say?&#8221; <br><br><b>Painting <br></b>I try to look at each picture as a film director considers a scene for a film, from many angles and in many lights, hoping to find a composition that is interesting and dynamic but that, above all, works to make the story stronger. <br><br>The studio is at times a sanctuary&#8212;where you&#8217;d rather be than anywhere else&#8212;or it is the last place you want to be&#8212;a place filled with monsters. <br><br>Sometimes I like working; other times I&#8217;d rather be doing anything else. My kitchen is never cleaner than when I&#8217;m in the middle of a project. <br><br>I&#8217;m generally lazy, but that&#8217;s overcome by the desire to see what comes next. My gadfly is curiosity. <br><br>At first, I have only an inkling of what I want a book to look like, and I&#8217;ll put those ideas down in pencil sketches or a rough dummy. This is a point of departure. What I imagine&#8212;the visuals in my head&#8212;are never as rich as the real thing, so I make something, and then either leave it, change it, or wipe it away and start over again. <br><br>I work slowly and I try to work on all the paintings, alternating from one to another each day (usually in no sensible pattern!).<br><br>I don&#8217;t think I create paintings as much as recognize them when I bump into them.<br><br>I use oil paints, which dry slowly and allow me to explore slowly. Oils also smell like painting&#8212;there is a sensory connection to history.<br><br>I visit museums and galleries as much as I can and I try to look at everything with an interested and curious eye. I always find something I never expected to be as wonderful as it is.<br><br>I wipe away about as much paint as I apply. It has to be a trial-and-error process. As soon as you are completely sure of what you&#8217;re doing, you are probably doing work that looks like work you&#8217;ve done before.<br><br><b>Why Children&#8217;s Books <br></b>Children are the best audience: they are curious, enthusiastic, impulsive, generous, and pleased by simple joys. They laugh easily at the ridiculous and are willing to believe the absurd. Children are not ironic, disillusioned, or indifferent, but hopeful, open-minded, and open-hearted, with a voracious hunger for pictures and stories.<br><br><b>Growing Up <br></b>As a boy, I read Wanda Gag, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Maurice Sendak, J.R.R. Tolkien, George Herriman, and any comic book I could get my hands on. I made drawings of fanciful machines after Rube Goldberg. I drew monsters, knights, dinosaurs, and ships. In school I drew complex space battles on notebook paper when I should have been learning the difference between &#8220;infer&#8221; and &#8220;imply.&#8221;<br><br>I wasn&#8217;t a very good student.

We worked in the children&#8217;s zoo, feeding the animals, cleaning the enclosures, and observing animals firsthand.<br><br>As a boy, I learned to sit back and sense the world around me.

Nixon has written over 130 books for children from preschool age through young adult&#8212;including science books, co-authored with her husband, geologist Hershell Nixon.

It was intriguing, suspenseful, and at times absolutely terrifying, and the title was correct. I <i>did</i> love a mystery&#8212;on radio, in films, and especially in books. Maybe I&#8217;m really a detective at heart because much later in my life, when I began to write books for young people, I discovered writing mysteries was even more fun than reading them.<br><br>&#8220;A mystery begins to develop in my mind when something sparks an idea and a question grows from it. What would it be like to move into a house in which a murder had taken place? How would I feel if my best friend were arrested for murder on circumstantial evidence? As a question develops into an answer, I give a great deal of thought to my main character. She is the most important part of the story, and I see it take shape through her eyes. Before I write a word of the story I know how I&#8217;ll begin it and how I&#8217;ll end it, making sure to put in honest clues and distracting red herrings&#8212;just to make the mystery all the more fun to solve. I love mysteries, and I want my readers to love them, too.&#8221;<br><br>In creating the acclaimed Orphan Train Adventures, Nixon explored a time and place in America&#8217;s recent past that is not widely covered in history lessons. She explains, &#8220;It was a part of history I hadn&#8217;t known: that beginning in 1854, over 100,000 homeless children were rescued from the streets of New York City and sent by train to new homes in the West. As I researched early journals, I found many letters&#8212;some hopeful, some sad&#8212;and reports which told of tears as brothers and sisters were separated or a child was not chosen. I wanted to bring history and fiction together in an exciting, adventurous time and place, to tell the stories of those who could have traveled west on the Orphan Train.&#8221;<br><br>Many of Nixon&#8217;s readers have written to her asking how to get published.

And so I thought, what if you did dwell upon it?&#160; What exactly would you see?&#160; <br><br>Months later I found myself on the winning end of a stack of history books about &ldquo;resurrection men&rdquo;&mdash;nineteenth-century grave robbers hired to steal bodies for use in medical school dissections.&#160; You might expect I&rsquo;d be disgusted at their adventures; instead, I found myself greatly impressed.&#160; There was an art to it.&#160; And like all arts, it was something that could be passed down, master to apprentice, or&mdash;even more interesting to me as an author&mdash;father to son.<br><br><u>THE CHALLENGE<br></u><br><i>Rotters</i> is a story about a boy named Joey Crouch who loses everything&mdash;his mother, his friends, his home, even his one talent is rendered useless&mdash;and then out of desperation turns to Ken Harnett, his mysterious and threatening biological father, only to find that Harnett is, in fact, the dad he&rsquo;s always needed.&#160; And this truth is in spite of&mdash;or maybe partly because of&mdash;what he does in graveyards under the cover of night.<br><br>I knew right away the biggest challenge in writing the book would be to generate sympathy for people who did something so repugnant.&#160; But I also knew right away that sympathy was possible, because the passing on of treasured information is by its very nature a tender act.&#160; Even Harnett&rsquo;s initial coldness is a form of tenderness: it&rsquo;s meant to turn Joey away from a dangerous and lonely life.&#160; When Joey is finally let in, he suffers a training period as cruel as that of any budding concert pianist, but what drives this merciless routine is, once again, love.&#160; The secrets Harnett reveal to Joey are no less than the secrets of mortality and how we deal with the promise of our own demise.&#160; It&rsquo;s heavy stuff, no doubt.&#160; But if handled with a little style and a lot of guts, I knew it could be the stuff of great literature, too.<br>&#160;<br><u>THE DARKNESS<br></u><br>We&rsquo;ve all seen those time-lapse films of the decomposition of a dead animal.&#160; At first, it&rsquo;s gross.&#160; But then the flesh&rsquo;s constant reinvention becomes fascinating, and, after a while, even sort of beautiful.&#160; It is my hope that Rotters has a similar effect&mdash;that if we, writer and reader, look hard enough together at something ugly, it might just transform into something magnificent.<br><br>Even before joining his father in the family business, the complications in Joey&rsquo;s life are legion: he&rsquo;s an outcast and his dad is the town pariah&mdash;not to mention that awful smell.&#160; But these burdens are nothing when compared to those of the men Joey meets: the underworld of grave robbers known as the Diggers.&#160; These Diggers are proud knights fighting for a dying kingdom and have given their entire lives to a labor no one will ever appreciate.&#160; Joey&rsquo;s arrival and his relationship with Harnett forces the Diggers to wonder if they&rsquo;ve wasted their lives.&#160; Surely no lurker of graveyards deserves a gift as great as love.&#160; This is a world of darkness that Joey has plunged into&mdash;and we haven&rsquo;t even gotten to Harnett&rsquo;s would-be brother Boggs, whose jealousy runs so deep that he&rsquo;ll stop at almost nothing to make Joey his own son.<br><br>Darkness is a defining characteristic of <i>Rotters</i>.&#160; But it&rsquo;s worthy to remember that darkness is just that&mdash;it&rsquo;s dark&mdash;and what is being concealed in the dark is not just the horrible and fearsome, it&rsquo;s also the inspirational and moving.&#160; Horror means nothing without happiness; dark means nothing without light.&#160; <i>Rotters</i> may make you feel scared, but hopefully it will also make you simply feel.&#160; It&rsquo;s that kind of book, or at least I hope it is.<br>&#160;<br>- Daniel Kraus"

484,True,David Adams,David Adams Richards,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/25454,Richards,False,"Born in 1950 in Newcastle, New Brunswick, David Adams Richards was the third of William and Margaret Richards' six children. He found his calling at the age of fourteen, after reading <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and embarked on a life of extraordinary purpose, one which he says didn't help his finances: ""Sometimes .&#160;.&#160;. I thought it would be better if I were a plumber, but I wouldn't be very good.""<br><br>At the age of twenty and after finishing his first novel, <i>The Keeping of Gusties</i>, Richards went in search of a community of writers. His quest ended when he met a group of academics at the University of New Brunswick. Richards would hitch-hike from his home in Newcastle to Fredericton every Tuesday night to meet with them and read from his work. The literary evenings were held on campus at McCourt Hall, in an outbuilding formally used to store ice. The group quickly became known as the Ice House Gang. There he received encouragement from established writers, including the late Alden Nowlan, whom he names as important influences along with Faulkner, Pushkin, Dostoevsky and Emily Bront&euml;. It was during his time with these writers that Richards wrote two-thirds of his second novel, <i>The Coming of Winter</i>, which was published by Oberon Press in 1974.<br><br>In 1971, Richards married Peggy McIntyre. They spent the first years of their marriage travelling throughout Canada, Europe and Australia. It was on these long sojourns away from the Mirimachi that Richards found he could write about the home he loved, regardless of where he lived. As he continued to write, Richards took postings as writer-in-residence at universities in New Brunswick, Ontario, Alberta and at Hollins University in Roanoke, Virginia. In 1997, they moved to Toronto with their sons John Thomas and Anton.<br><br>The Miramichi region has continued as the heart of Richards' fiction throughout his career. As he explained in an interview with <i>January</i> <i>Magazine</i>, his connection to the area and to the rural lives of its inhabitants is central to his fiction, yet does not reflect a limited scope: ""It's very important, because the characters come from the soil. They're like the trees, in a certain respect. They cling to that river and that soil, but as Jack Hodgins once said about my writing&mdash;which was one of the kindest things any writer has said about my writing&mdash;he said: 'David, you aren't writing about the Miramichi Valley, you're writing about Campbell River where I come from. Because every character you talk about is a character I've met here in Campbell River.' And that's basically what I'm doing. Of course my people are Miramichi. Of course they come from the fabric and the soil of the Miramichi but if that was the only thing that was interesting about them, I wouldn't bother writing about them.""<br><br>The relocation to Toronto was not without its difficulties, though. As Richards documented in the memoir <i>Lines on the Water</i>, he loves fly-fishing on the Miramichi River. Yet once he was no longer a resident, he was unable to get a fishing licence for the region. Thankfully, said Richards, the local government proclaimed him an ""honorary Miramichier""&mdash;""So I can go fishing. It was very nice of them and very touching."" He has also written a non-fiction book on the place of hockey in the Canadian soul, called <i>Hockey Dreams</i>.<br><br>Richards has received numerous awards and prizes throughout his career. Most notably, he is one of few writers in the history of the Governor General's Literary Awards to win in both the fiction (<i>Nights Below Station Street</i>) and non-fiction (<i>Lines on the Water</i>) categories. In addition to these two wins, he was nominated for <i>Road to the Stilt House</i> (in 1985), <i>For Those Who Hunt the Wounded Down</i> (in 1993) and <i>Mercy Among the Children</i> (in 2000). Considered by many to be Richards' most accomplished novel, <i>Mercy</i> was co-winner of the Giller Award in 2000, and was shortlisted for the Trillium Award and the Thomas Raddell Award. It also won the Canadian Booksellers Association author of the year and fiction book of the year awards. Over the years, Richards has also won countless regional awards for his novels and was awarded the prestigious Canada-Australia Literary Prize in 1992. More recently,&#160;<i>The Lost Highway</i>&#160;was shortlisted for the Governor General&rsquo;s Literary Award and longlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and&#160;<i>The Friends of Meagre Fortune</i>&#160;won the Commonwealth Writers&rsquo; Prize for Best Book and was longlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize.&#160;<br><br>Despite all of these successes, it was years before Richards made money at writing. He laughs at the sales of his early work: ""For a long while if I sold 200 books, I'd be saying: Oh, great! And, you know, a $50 advance! That's great. I only worked three years, I don't know if I can spend $50.""<br><br>Also a screenwriter, Richards has adapted a number of his novels for the small screen. In 1990, he adapted his novel <i>Nights Below Station Street</i>, and in 1994 he penned the teleplay ""Small Gifts,"" for which he won his first Gemini. He won his second for his screen adaptation of <i>For Those Who Hunt the Wounded Down</i>, and later co-wrote the screenplay for<i> The Bay of Love and Sorrows</i>, released as a feature film in 2002.<br><br>In addition to his novels and non-fiction books, Richards' short stories and articles have been published in literary magazines and anthologies. His literary papers were acquired in 1994 by the University of New Brunswick."

486,True,Chris,Chris Raschka,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/67939,Raschka,False,"I&rsquo;m sometimes asked about my general approach to illustration, which has over the years come to be described as minimal. Hmm, I&rsquo;m not sure minimal is such a complimentary term, but I&rsquo;ll accept it. I wasn&rsquo;t always minimal. In the early days I was laying it on as thickly as I could, trying very hard to get it right. But I found that the harder I tried, the more tired whatever it was I was working on looked. And then I grew tired of it as well.<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;There is too much sweat in it,&rdquo; is how my friend, the artist Vladimir Radunsky, would put it.&#160;<br> &#160;<br> Perhaps he means that there has been an imposition of too much of my will upon the material with which I was working. It is an offhand remark of Wordsworth&rsquo;s that helped me when I needed a new way to move forward: &ldquo;The matter always comes out of the manner.&rdquo; How you say something has direct bearing on what you say.<br> &#160;<br> So, if you labor heavily upon a work of art, then part of what you are saying is, this is a heavy work of art. If you happen to be trying to say something about lightness, then the art should be light as well.<br> &#160;<br> It is much the same with food. There are heavy meals and light meals. There are sauces that contain endless lists of ingredients, and there are sauces that contain only a few but in exquisite proportion. Does an apple taste best bitten directly into, sliced thinly with a light squeeze of lemon, or baked for an hour with nutmeg, sugar, cinnamon, flour and egg whites? Maybe the answer is that there is a time for all of those things.<br> &#160;<br> My answer in my illustration has been to allow the materials to speak as directly as possible. I want each and every entire brushstroke to be seen. I want the marks made by the tip of the brush to carry as much meaning as the marks made by the dragging tail end, the part that splits open as the paint pulls away, thins and dries. I want each brushstroke to have a beginning, a middle, and an end, a story in itself and a life in itself. Then the life of this brushstroke can wrestle with the life of the brushstroke next to it. There is enough action there between two brushstrokes for a little story. And what happens when the next brushstroke comes in a different color?&#160;<br> &#160;<br> It could be epic. Of course, if it&rsquo;s just brushstrokes wrestling around, it isn&rsquo;t much of a picture book is it? There still has to be a picture. And maybe it needs to be a picture of a dog named Daisy or a little girl riding a bike. So I have to be careful before I get too carried away in the manner itself.<br> &#160;<br> In the end, this is how it goes in my books. There are always two stories happening: one is me having fun watching brushstrokes wrestle, and the other is the story told in pictures and words on a page. It may be minimal, but it&rsquo;s enough for me."

I had finished a middle-grade novel, <i>The World&#8217;s Most Disgusting Sandwich</i>, and was trying to get it published.<br>&#8220;It has potential,&#8221; a potential agent told me. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to see other books you&#8217;ve written.&#8221;<br>Other books I&#8217;d written? I hadn&#8217;t written any other books. I had written an anonymous poetry column for a teachers&#8217; newsletter. I had written a bunch of essays in college and graduate school. I had written some irreverent songs to play on my guitar. &#8220;This is my first book,&#8221; I confessed. <br>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t typically represent books, we represent writers. Are you working on something else?&#8221;<br>I had started on a sequel and began to tell her about it.<br>&#8220;I mean something different,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to see what else you can do.&#8221;<br>Oh, crap. &#8220;I have a few other ideas,&#8221; I said. <br>She told me when I had something written she&#8217;d be happy to take a look.<br>So I came up with a new idea in a hurry and started writing the fictional memoir of Zeke Zagger, the world&#8217;s greatest super villain that nobody had ever heard of. It was supposed to be funny; instead it was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful. Reading over the first 20 pages, I began to worry about the state of my subconscious. <br><br>So I decided to try again with a new character, and the first thing I wanted to do was give him a name. Shakespeare. Shakespeare Shapiro. Wow, I thought, imagine being that kid. So I did imagine it, and I started to vent on paper. It turned out Shakespeare Shapiro had a lot to say, not just about his name, but also about his crazy parents, his maddeningly popular younger brother, his social ineptitude, and the overall catastrophe of his life. Much of what he said was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful; but it was also really funny to me. And I guess it was funny to other people, too, because <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is set to hit the bookstores on September 25, 2007.<br><br>As an eighth-grade teacher, it is both incredibly exciting and a little bit nerve wracking to have written a book that I know my students&#8211;and probably their parents&#8211;will read. I&#8217;m excited to become a minor celebrity for the first time in my life, at least within the walls of Manhattan&#8217;s Middle School 255. I&#8217;m excited that my students will see me as a real live writer, and I will be thrilled if more of them are inspired to carry on independent writing lives. But I wonder how they and their parents will react to the fact that the book deals so openly with the kinds of things teenage boys think about. Just imagine parent-teacher conferences, if you will: <br> <br><b>PARENT #1</b>: So, Jake, we read your book.<br><br><b>ME</b> (<i>smiling nervously)</i>: Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you how Becky is doing in class. Her writing is&#8211;<br><br><b>PARENT #2 </b><i>(holding up a copy)</i>: Masturbation. Drug use. Pornography. You seem quite well versed in these subjects . . .<br><br>You get the idea. So to the question of how much of <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is autobiographical, let me just say that nothing has ever been proven. And as to the rumors that I&#8217;m now working on a musical called <i>Castration Celebration</i>, I&#8217;ll have to plead the fifth."

Our dinner table has always been where the events of the day are reported with great hilarity or drama, sometimes both at once. That taught us about pacing, delivery, what works and what doesn't. We read a lot. Possibly because we had no TV. <br><br><b>So dinner was a long series of teachable moments?</b><br>We didn't know we were learning and my parents didn't know they were teaching. It was just dinner. My siblings and I were brought up to value original thinking, honorable behavior, laughter, and books. Our passions were taken seriously. They didn't dwell on our shortcomings&ndash;math, science, Latin. We were never described as aspiring. Michael was a writer, Meg an actress, Nell a scientist. I was an artist. Our titles expanded as our interests grew. Ultimately, three out of the four of us became writers. My parents became the models for Lucy Rose's grandparents, Madam and Pop.<br><br><b>How did you get into writing professionally?</b><br><br>I was working as an illustrator and walking the floors with our darling, relentlessly colicky baby when a friend called to ask if I would like a two-day-a-week job doing basic research and phone answering at <i>People </i>magazine. I would have done it for free.<br><br>I started covering parties for <i>People </i>and graduated to bigger stories. Six years and another baby later, I was hired as a feature writer for <i>USA Today's</i> Life section. Reporting taught me to write fast and to be frugal with words, and it let me ask questions that would be rude under any other circumstances. I spent time in Hollywood with movie stars, in Washington with the president, and in Mississippi with people who lived in houses that rented for $60 a month. No plumbing, no electricity, one good wind from toppling over. I learned to listen to what people were (and weren' t) saying, to understand what they cherished and what they feared. I can't imagine that I could write good fiction without having reported on so many real lives.<br><b><br>Where do you get your ideas?</b><br>In schools, on the subway, in the market. Something happens and it triggers an idea. My first book, <i>Lucy Rose: Here's the Thing About Me, </i>came about when, one night at family dinner, my mom said about her dog, ""Poppy has been so much better since I've been telling her where I'm going and what time I'll be back."" That struck me as hilarious. After they left, I typed the words: ""My grandmother thinks her dog can tell time."" The story took off from there. Until my mom said that I hadn't thought about writing a children's book. I tell aspiring writers to eavesdrop. It's a great way to get ideas and to get a sense of how people really talk. When you have something, write it down as soon as you can.<br><br><b>How do you write?</b><br>I follow the advice of that old Nike ad: Just Do It. Lots of people think about writing a book but say, ""I don't have time,"" or ""I'm waiting for inspiration,"" or ""I want to get it worked out in my head first."" If you want to write, carve out the time. If you write a page a day in a year you'll have the first draft of a novel.<br><br><b>What are the biggest writing mistakes people make?</b><br>Thinking bigger words are better words, becoming wedded to every word so they can't bear to throw anything out. Many writers repeat themselves. Say it once. Readers are smart. They remember.<br><br><b>How do you sharpen your work?</b><br>What works best for me is to write a bit, edit, make changes, write some more, and repeat from the beginning. When I finish a piece, I go through it once just to find and banish clich&eacute;s. Then I run a search for the words very and really. They take up space and almost never help the writing. I read my work out loud. That is the surest, quickest way to tell if the voices ring true or the writing is lumpy.<br><br><b>Who are you favorite writers?</b><br>I have many. Katharine Patterson, Judy Blume, Lois Lowery, Dick King-Smith, P. G. Wodehouse, Ian Falconer, S. E. Hinton, Harper Lee, Daniel Wallace.<br><br><b>Your favorite book?</b><br>I can't pick a favorite. But I am in awe of Ernest Hemingway's six word short story: ""For sale: Baby shoes, never worn."" <br><br><b>Do you start with an outline?</b><br>No. But I do make a list of five or six things that are going to happen. Sometimes I change my mind, but the list gives me some direction.<br><br><b>Are Washington, D.C., and Capitol Hill like they are in the Lucy Rose and Melonhead books?</b><br>The neighborhood has been gentrified, but it is still full of families and dogs and shops and adventures. (Almost all of the places in the book are real.) When we were young, my brother and sisters and I spent our days roaming around the Capitol, playing pick-up soccer on the Library of Congress lawn and dropping in on the Smithsonian museums. We regularly climbed the 897 steps to the top of the Washington Monument and took so many tours of the FBI that the guides recognized us. When my dad was a young reporter, he used to meet Harry Truman at Union (train) Station and they' d do the interview while they walked. Washington is less free-wheeling now. Security is tighter, kids can't tour the FBI without an adult, you have to go through your Congressperson to get a White House ticket, and you have to take the elevator to the top of the Washington Monument. <br><br><b>Your family has lived on the same block of Constitution Avenue for generations.</b><br><br>It's been a good place to chart change. My dad was born at home in 1923. One of his earliest memories is seeing the KKK march past the house in 1925. He was two years old. In August 1963, when I was seven, thousands of people in the March on Washington walked the same route to hear Dr. King deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. My mom was days away from having my sister Nell, and her obstetrician wouldn't allow her to walk that far. Instead she, my brother Michael, my sister Meg, and I passed out free lemonade and cookies all day. (My dad was reporting on the March for the <i>Washington Daily News</i>.) In January 2009 all of us, including my eight-year-old nephew watched hundreds of thousands of people walk past the house on the way to see President Obama get inaugurated.<br><b><br>Out of four Kelly kids, three became writers. What do they do?</b><br>My sister Meg is a screenwriter. For years she wrote for soap operas. Until recently she was the co-headwriter for <i>Days of Our Lives</i>.<br><br>My brother Michael reported for the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>New Yorker</i> and the <i>National Journal</i>. He was a syndicated columnist, the author of <i>Martyr's Day</i> and the editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. It is the great heartbreak of our lives that Michael was killed while reporting on the first days of the war in Iraq in 2003.<br><br>My sister Nell has the most important job in the family. She teaches kindergarten and first grade.<br><br><b>What do you tell kids who want to be writers?</b><br>Do it! I've met a lot of artists and singers and writers who were going to college to study business or teaching or dental hygiene. People, often parents, have convinced them that their passion is too risky for real life. Pursue the practical, they say, you can always sing in the church choir, paint on the side, write in your off-hours. Though said with love, this is lousy advice. Passions almost always stem from talent. And when you're talented and work hard, you get jobs.<br><br><b>How did you get your book published?</b><br>After I finished, I sent it to four agents. I have still not heard back from them. It was my great good fortune to have a friend who passed my manuscript on to his editor. That said, I do believe good books get published, just not as fast as one hopes.<br><br><b>What can a children's book writer do to find a publisher?</b><br>Join the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. They have groups all over the country. Go to their workshops. Make contacts. Have faith.<br><br><b>Fun facts about Katy Kelly:</b><br><br>She has two children, Emily and Marguerite.<br><br>She married her college sweetheart. His name is Steve.<br><br>She has a dog named Ellie. When Katy was a kid, she had a big, black French Poodle named Gumbo. He appears in the Lucy Rose and Melonhead books.<br><br>She lives in Washington, D.C.<br><br>She loves visiting schools.<br><br>She spends much of her money at bookstores.<br><br>She is wild for ice cream and chocolate and especially chocolate ice cream.<br><br>She is anti-cauliflower.<br><br>She draws and paints.<br><br>Her office is in her house. It is pink and green and jazzy.<br><br>If she could choose one extra talent, it would be singing. <br><br>Her mom, Marguerite Kelly, is the author of <i>The Mother's Almanac</i>.<br><br>Madam and Pop are now celebrities in their neighborhood.<br><br><b>About the author</b><br>Katy Kelly is the daughter of writers. She and her siblings grew up on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., five blocks away from the U.S. Capitol, four from the Senate buildings, and three from the U.S. Supreme Court.<br>She was a reporter and editor for 20 years before becoming an author."

634,False,Michelle,Michelle Houts,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/79911,Houts,False,"&#8220;<i>When Mr. and Mrs. Jim Darling named their first daughter Precious the whole town wanted to puke</i>.&#8221; That line from <i>The Beef Princess of Practical County</i> came to me long before the rest of the story. I grew up in a word-loving environment. My father is the king of puns, spoonerisms, and wordplay. The idea of a character named Precious Darling was intriguing. Would she be precious? Or darling? Of course not. Life rarely works out that way. Precious Darling and her equally ironically named sisters stuck with me and begged me to write about them. (Of course they did. They&#8217;re that vain!) Other characters I write about have more realistic roots. Libby, the main character in the story, is a cross between several strong young people I&#8217;ve known over the years. Frannie, Libby&#8217;s little sister, is very much like a precocious and always-entertaining young lady who is growing up my house. <br><br>I&#8217;ve spent the second half my life-so-far on a farm. I grew up with farming relatives, but my family and I lived in the suburbs. I spent a lot of summer days visiting my cousin&#8217;s dairy farm, searching the haymow for new kittens and learning to walk barefooted in manure. I didn&#8217;t always love the farm animals. I used to have nightmares about huge Holstein cows walking up my driveway. When I went to college and met the farmer of my dreams, I knew I&#8217;d have to face my animal fears head on. Those big, old steers can still make me take a step backwards (away from their back end), but I&#8217;ve grown to respect them. <br><br>I&#8217;m always so impressed when I watch young people with their livestock at a county fair. The level of maturity, the amount of time and energy, and the physical nature of the work they do are amazing. (Not to mention, it&#8217;s just a dirty and sometimes stinky job to clean up after farm animals.) But there is nothing quite like auction night. The lights, the auctioneer&#8217;s booming song, the ringman&#8217;s yelping call to signal a bid, the pacing animals in the ring, and most of all, the youngsters at the other end of the lead rope. The emotions on their faces are as mixed as the feelings in their hearts. Pride. They&#8217;ve raised an outstanding, functional animal. Excitement. It&#8217;s the night they&#8217;ve worked for all year. Heartbreak. In minutes, it&#8217;ll be over. It will be time to say goodbye. <br><br>When I wrote about this in <i>The Beef Princess of Practical County</i>, my editor asked me what I suppose anyone who hasn&#8217;t experienced farm life would ask. Why? Why do the kids do it again and again if it&#8217;s such a painful life experience? That was my challenge in completing the book. How will Libby face the auction ring? Will she even face it at all? Writing is about living, and living is about growing and making decisions that ring true to your own beliefs. Libby may have faced some of the toughest decisions she ever had to make, but she always remained true to herself. Even in the presence of the dreaded, ditzy Darling sisters. And that&#8217;s no bull!"

664,False,Rudy,Rudy Wiebe,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/33129,Wiebe,False,"Rudy Wiebe was born on October 4, 1934, in an isolated farm community of about 250 people in a rugged but lovely region near Fairholme, Saskatchewan. His parents had escaped Soviet Russia with five children in 1930, part of the last generation of homesteaders to settle the Canadian West, and part of a Mennonite history of displacement and emigration through Europe and Asia to North and South America since the seventeenth century. In 1947 his family gave up their bush farm and moved to Coaldale, Alberta, a town east of Lethbridge peopled largely by Ukrainians, Mennonites, Mormons, and Central Europeans, as well as Japanese, who ended up there during WW II.<br><br>Rudy Wiebe read as much as possible from an early age; his first reading materials were the Bible, the Eaton's catalogue and the <i>Free Press Weekly Prairie Farmer</i>; he also recalls listening to his parents&#8217; stories of Russia. By Grade 4, he had read through the two shelves of books available in the one-room schoolhouse. Growing up, he enjoyed <b>Les Miserables, Toilers of the Sea, David Copperfield, Tom Brown's Schooldays</b>, Greek myths and Norse legends. Later an admirer of Faulkner, M&#225;rquez, Borges and Tolstoy, Wiebe has always held to the fundamentals of plot, character and, above all, story. He believes stories should begin in the specific and local but expand into &#8220;a human truth larger than any individual.&#8221;<br><br>Wiebe won his first prize for fiction while studying literature at the University of Alberta, where he enrolled in a writing class and began producing poems, plays and stories. His winning story in a Canada-wide contest recounted a young boy&#8217;s response to the death of his sister &#8211; based on Wiebe&#8217;s own experience &#8211; and was published in the magazine <i>Liberty</i> in 1956. After earning his B.A., Wiebe left for the ancient University of T&#252;bingen in West Germany on a Rotary Fellowship to study literature and theology, an experience that increased his respect for older and richer communities. Tena Isaak of British Columbia joined him there and they were married. The couple travelled in England, Austria, Switzerland and Italy before returning to Edmonton, where Wiebe completed his M.A. in creative writing. His thesis grew into his first novel, <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b>. <br><br>In 1962 Wiebe earned a Bachelor of Theology degree from the Mennonite Brethren Bible College; he considered becoming a minister. He was editor of Winnipeg&#8217;s <i>Mennonite Brethren Herald</i> when <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b><i> </i>was published. Many conservative ministers and Mennonites in small towns objected to the novel's frank and at times unflattering portrait of community life, and there was considerable opposition to the book. &#8220;I wasn't exactly sacked as editor . . . but the committee came to me and said &#8216;Ahem.&#8217; I resigned.&#8221; The strength of this reaction made him think hard about the power of the written word, and reinforced his sense of wanting to be a writer.<br><br>Wiebe then was invited to teach at a Mennonite college in Goshen, an agricultural town in Indiana with a large Mennonite and Amish population, where he would be Assistant Professor of English from 1963 to 1967. Goshen College was a lively and stimulating intellectual community where Wiebe committed himself to writing, study, teaching and travel. &#8220;I encountered men and women of real perception . . . really literate Christians who saw themselves as Jesus's followers and at the same time were acquainted with the thoughts of others and had brought that kind of understanding to bear on what it means to be a Christian. The best thing that ever happened to me was the meetings we had every two or three weeks in one home or another &#8211; seven or eight of us, a psychiatrist, a couple of theologians, a couple of literary people. There were the best theologians there, I think, the Mennonite Church has ever had.&#8221; <br><br>Wiebe published his second novel, <b>First and Vital Candle</b>, and began to explore the western United States and the Mennonite settlements in Paraguay. He returned to Edmonton as a professor in creative writing and English at the University of Alberta, and immersed himself in Canadian literature. He wrote reviews, essays and articles, edited anthologies and was soon established as a major figure in Canadian letters. In 1973, his novel <b>The Temptations of Big Bear</b> won a Governor General's Award. Since then he has continued to win the highest praise for his books of fiction and non-fiction. He has written numerous film and television scripts, lectured internationally from Denmark to India, and given readings from Adelaide to Puerto Rico to Helsinki and Igloolik. For thirty years he taught literature and creative writing at colleges and universities in Canada, the United States and Germany. Now retired from teaching, his former students include such accomplished writers as Myrna Kostash, Aritha van Herk, Thomas Wharton and Katherine Govier.<br>  <br>Wiebe was called the first major Mennonite writer to place his community&#8217;s experience in a broader framework. Mennonites assert the fundamental authority of Scripture, especially the New Testament, as a practical guide to life. But while Wiebe imbues his work with a deep moral seriousness, his focus has always been on narrative. &#8220;I never consciously think of writing a so-called Christian novel. I don&#8217;t think Albert Camus ever thought of writing an existentialist novel, either. I think of getting at, of building, a story.&#8221; As a prairie writer, he has often concerned himself with Native stories, feeling place of birth to be more important than blood ancestry. &#8220;Those Mennonite villages in Russia are my heritage, but not my world. The world I feel and sense in my bones is the bush of northern Saskatchewan, of prairie Canada.&#8221; Native spirituality, with its vital links to the physical world, has always attracted him. But his fiction manages to transcend nationality and locale to explore the struggles of communities and individuals; his books and stories have been translated into nine European languages, as well as Chinese, Japanese and Hindi.<br><br>Whatever Wiebe&#8217;s focus in a given work, he has always chosen ambitious themes, and his work rewards readers with an intensity seldom rivalled. He is a voice of Canadian fiction that cannot be ignored, and whose work promises to endure."

Nixon has written over 130 books for children from preschool age through young adult&#8212;including science books, co-authored with her husband, geologist Hershell Nixon.

It was intriguing, suspenseful, and at times absolutely terrifying, and the title was correct. I <i>did</i> love a mystery&#8212;on radio, in films, and especially in books. Maybe I&#8217;m really a detective at heart because much later in my life, when I began to write books for young people, I discovered writing mysteries was even more fun than reading them.<br><br>&#8220;A mystery begins to develop in my mind when something sparks an idea and a question grows from it. What would it be like to move into a house in which a murder had taken place? How would I feel if my best friend were arrested for murder on circumstantial evidence? As a question develops into an answer, I give a great deal of thought to my main character. She is the most important part of the story, and I see it take shape through her eyes. Before I write a word of the story I know how I&#8217;ll begin it and how I&#8217;ll end it, making sure to put in honest clues and distracting red herrings&#8212;just to make the mystery all the more fun to solve. I love mysteries, and I want my readers to love them, too.&#8221;<br><br>In creating the acclaimed Orphan Train Adventures, Nixon explored a time and place in America&#8217;s recent past that is not widely covered in history lessons. She explains, &#8220;It was a part of history I hadn&#8217;t known: that beginning in 1854, over 100,000 homeless children were rescued from the streets of New York City and sent by train to new homes in the West. As I researched early journals, I found many letters&#8212;some hopeful, some sad&#8212;and reports which told of tears as brothers and sisters were separated or a child was not chosen.

I do that a lot as a writer&mdash;challenge myself to try new things&mdash;and tackling a fairy tale was <i>definitely</i> a new thing. So how to begin?&#160;<br><br>I knew I wanted my story to have a classical feel, incorporating such wonderfully delicious fairy-tale elements as four-and-twenty blackbirds, enchanted forests, and hairy trolls. On the other hand, I wanted it to be totally original, a story like no other. I began writing, and within a few weeks had a tale. But let me tell you a curious truth about writers&mdash;they <i>are</i> the stories they write, the fictions they spin. And when I read back what I had written, I realized I had created a fairy tale about . . . <i>me</i>. Weird, but true! The story is filled with my favorite things&mdash;journeys and birthdays and cake. The princess, taking after my son Scott, is allergic to strawberries. And Jack? Just like me, he good-naturedly follows life&rsquo;s road, gathering experiences he can spin into tales.<br><br>Spinning experiences into tales is what I did with <i>The Fabled Fifth Graders of Aesop Elementary School</i>, too. I visit lots of school, and there&rsquo;s nothing I like better than talking with kids, watching them in the lunchroom or on the playground, reading their essays and stories, listening to them tell jokes. And all the while I&rsquo;m doing these things, I&rsquo;m thinking about how I can use them in a book. Let me give you an example. A few years ago, I was visiting a school in Tennessee when a fifth-grade boy came up to me and said, &ldquo;Look what I can do.&rdquo; He stuck out his tongue, crossed his eyes and wiggled his ears &ndash; first the left one, and then the right one. I was impressed&mdash;but I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything yet! Within seconds, the rest of the fifth graders surround me. Everyone, it seemed, had some special body trick to show me&mdash;double-jointed fingers and toes, eyelids that folded, lips that could be pulled up over noses, knuckles that cracked to the tune of &ldquo;Yankee Doodle.&rdquo; It was absurd and wonderful, and I knew I had to write about it. The result? Chapter five titled, &ldquo;Hyper . . . Um . . . Hypermob . . . Um . . . Weird Body Tricks.&rdquo;</p>"

I was the youngest of three kids and I didn&#8217;t follow in any of my siblings&#8217; footsteps.<br><br>I did all kinds of things in my quest to have adventures, but I lived in a small town, so my efforts were limited. I taught myself to play the guitar. I stole rides with boys on minibikes. I wrote long letters to local DJs, getting them to play my song requests and to read my thoughts on the air. I wrote poems and sent them off to magazines. I was published at fourteen and again at fifteen, at which time I was also paid ten dollars. It was the beginning of my life as a professional writer. It wasn&#8217;t until after I had moved away from home that I began to understand how growing up in the South had shaped my personality as well as my voice as a writer. <br><br>I had a strong desire to talk about how circumstances are handed down through the generations. It doesn&#8217;t mean that people are doomed by their circumstances. It does mean that people, even young people, have to recognize where and what they come from, and in some instances, they have to do a certain amount of work to overcome it. The South has had to overcome the burden of slavery. It is a problem they brought upon themselves, and there is still a price to be paid. Such a burden often falls on children: we have to clean up the mess our ancestors made, much as young people today will have to help clean up what generations before have done to the environment.<br><br>I believe that few people understand the South very well these days. I have a fifteen-year-old daughter, and I notice how she is taught about it in school. They brush past the Civil War, and no one talks about the South much because no one really cares about the losers. The Civil War was not only about slavery, it was also about state versus federal rights. The South wanted to rule itself badly enough to go to war; that gives you an idea of what a proud society it once was. One important part of history that had a great impact on my ancestors was the era of Reconstruction. That&#8217;s when the North tried to help the South put the pieces back together, but their efforts were not always admirable. It was a terrible period in our history, and people still remember it and talk about it. In <u>The Noah Confessions,</u> I decided to write a little bit about the Reconstruction in an effort to help myself and others understand how it affected my life.<br><br>Everything in the South is gothic. There is a heightened sense of drama carved out of a history of gentility and manners. Southerners turn small things into big ones; at the same time they deal stoically with larger matters. Insults are big on the scale; death is matter of fact. Southerners are not afraid of salt, grease, dirt, germs or alcohol. They are afraid of lawyers, doctors and pills. It still seems like a sound philosophy to me.<br><br>Secrets are big in the South, and they are often confused with privacy, which is how I ended up writing a book on that subject. Secrets create mystery; people who do not like to keep secrets or become the victims of them naturally become detectives in their own lives. Children should never be asked to keep secrets, particularly the secrets of their families.<br><br>Many aspects of my family were shrouded in mystery because the habit of secrecy was passed down over generations. When I would ask about my ancestors my mother would often say, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know much about that side,&#8221; or &#8220;You might want to be careful what you go digging for.&#8221; I don&#8217;t believe my family was aware of being secretive; I think they believed they were being private or minding their own business. The problem came when I, as a passionately curious person, needed to know more than I was allowed. And in some cases, more than I could handle.<br><br>The secrets revealed in <u>Noah</u> are much more dramatic than the ones I uncovered in my own life. But the dynamic is similar. Whenever I was told something that didn&#8217;t add up, getting to the truth became a dangerous mission that threatened my position in the family. Going a step further and talking about it granted me black sheep status from time to time. But there was no way to fully understand myself or my experience without knowing the history leading up to me. This is why I spent a lot of time later in life wading through both the story of my family and the story of the town I grew up in.<br><br>Much of the history of the South became lost or distorted because of the Civil War. During Reconstruction, the real secrets began. People had to hide things so that they wouldn&#8217;t be taken or stolen. Confederate money was worthless, so other valuables had to be buried. Property had to be disguised. In many cases, entire families were turned out on the streets, having lost everything to the war. And sometimes, oftentimes, people had to resort to illegal activities to survive. Bootlegging, smuggling, black market schemes, secret societies. Eventually the South regained its respectability by rebuilding proper industries. But for a while, for many families, the only way to survive was to live outside the rules.<br><br>The tradition of not airing your dirty laundry, or any other kind, was born from that particular time in history. If you look back far enough in almost any Southern family, you are going to find the black sheep who resorted to activities no one wants to discuss.<br><br>In <u>The Noah Confessions,</u> I wanted to write about a girl who is harboring an enormous secret and how that has stopped her from having a normal life. In this case, she&#8217;s afraid it will prevent her from ever being free or happy. She knows that her devotion to the truth has the power to alienate her from her entire family. She also knows it is her only salvation. I have always been interested in writing about teenagers who have to face choices like that. Even in <u>Joan of Arcadia,</u> I chose to write about a teenager with a mission so big that most adults couldn&#8217;t handle it.<br><br>I wanted to show the connections from one generation to the next and to validate the coming-of-age struggle, which is a struggle to understand your immediate environment and, at the same time, to put yourself in some kind of historical context. I believe it is the best way to discover your purpose&#8211;which is the most fascinating and worthwhile journey you can ever take. It is the song that never ends.<br><br>But what a song. Turn it up loud."

Which is sort of akin to the process of being a human being, even if you aren&#8217;t a writer. . . . And seriously, what is writing, other than telling stories about being a human being?&quot;--Daniel Ehrenhaft</i><br><br><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><br><br>If there&#8217;s one thing you can say about Daniel Ehrenhaft&#8211;aside from the fact that he&#8217;s worn the same corduroys for the past eleven years&#8211;it&#8217;s that he has a difficult time writing about himself.  So when Random House asked him to contribute a little autobiography for this Website, he was naturally apprehensive.  <br><br>At first, he decided to do some research on the subject of autobiography.  He referred to this very site to read what other Random House authors had written about themselves.  It didn&#8217;t help.  For starters, he discovered that all these authors led fascinating, productive lives. To make matters worse, they all offered trenchant insight about what it means to be a writer. <br><br>As far as Mr. Ehrenhaft can tell, his own life as a writer boils down to a six-part regimen:<br><br>1) Drinking cheap coffee<br>2) Procrastinating (fiddling with the stereo, playing air guitar, etc.)<br>3) Reading a lot. Often, he&#8217;ll read something brilliant or moving or hilarious by someone he&#8217;s never read before, someone whose words end up blowing his mind&#8211;which is followed by<br>4) Jealousy and panic <br>5) Lunch  <br>6) A nap<br><br>But, in a strange way, this process does eventually inspire him to put pen to paper. (Or his fingertips to the computer keyboard, as it were.) After all, he knows what it&#8217;s like to be scared, and to put things off, and to worry about opening up to perfect strangers.  Which is sort of akin to the process of being a human being, even if you aren&#8217;t a writer. <br><br>And seriously, what <i>is</i> writing, other than telling stories about being a human being?  If that sounds evasive and simplistic&#8230;well, maybe it is.  On the other hand, that&#8217;s probably why a lot of writers do what they do.  They open up in their stories in ways that&#8211;at their best&#8211;illuminate truths and complexities not only about themselves, but about their readers, as well.  They write precisely so they don&#8217;t have to be evasive, which is what makes reading such a blast.  <br><br>So really, Daniel Ehrenhaft just writes because he loves to read, and he aspires to do what all his favorite authors have done for him.  In fact, if he had it his way, he would get <i>paid</i> to read.  Then again, if he had it his way, he and his wife would live in a huge castle with a billiards room and a pool shaped like a figure eight, and a custom-made electric guitar signed by the surviving members of The Clash.  <br><br>Until that happens, though, he&#8217;ll probably keep writing."

I am, and always have been, from the &ldquo;Only Boring People Are Bored&rdquo; school of thought, and worked hard as a child to develop and use my imagination. One of my favorite experiences from that time of my life is when I decided I had a future in Hollywood. <br>&#160;<br>It practically kills me to admit this, but I got the idea from a made-for-TV movie on &ldquo;The Wonderful World of Disney,&rdquo; a Sunday evening staple in our home in Andover, Ohio.&#160; Johnny Whitacre, who was my age, starred in <i>The Mystery of Dracula&rsquo;s Castle, </i>in which his character makes a movie. I was nothing if not stubborn, and figured that if Johnny Whitacre could do it, so could I.&#160; And so, at thirteen, armed with my dad&rsquo;s 8-millimeter movie camera, some plastic fangs, and a few tubes of fake blood, I set out to make a horror movie.&#160; <br>&#160;<br>I was determined to do Mr. Smarty-Pants Whitacre one better, though. I had no intention of recycling somebody else&rsquo;s creation; I wanted a monster of my own.&#160; Tucked away in our bunk beds, my brother Steve and I whispered creepy-creature names at each other in the dark until we hit the jackpot: The Seaweed Strangler.&#160; We lived on Pymatuning Lake, which has more than its share of seaweed and swampy locations, and now that I had a main character and a setting, I was on my way.&#160; <br>&#160;<br>Okay, so <i>The Seaweed Strangler</i> didn&rsquo;t win any awards, and I didn&rsquo;t go on to become the next Steven Spielberg (who also started out with an 8-mm camera, by the way).&#160; The truth is that the movie is still a work in progress.&#160; I continue to blame the film editing machine that broke down in mid-edit thirty-plus years ago, but now that I&rsquo;ve had the film transferred to DVD, I&rsquo;m running out of excuses not to finish it.&#160;&#160; (All of which really irritates Steve, who still hasn&rsquo;t forgiven me for the two weeks he spent walking barefoot through the muck and mire while draped in seaweed!) <br>&#160;&#160; <br>Last summer, though, I found a way to revive the Seaweed Strangler -- to bring the creature, and my movie, back to life.&#160; I started work on a novel about a boy who discovers his father&rsquo;s partially finished movie -- titled, you guessed it, <i>The Seaweed Strangler</i> - and decides to add a few scenes of his own.&#160; No, I don&rsquo;t have a son in real life, but that&rsquo;s the best part about being a writer: I get to make stuff up, and use my imagination to let my characters do all the things I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>, or <i>hope</i> to, or don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to, or would <i>never</i>, do."

837,False,Chris,Chris Raschka,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/67939,Raschka,False,"I&rsquo;m sometimes asked about my general approach to illustration, which has over the years come to be described as minimal. Hmm, I&rsquo;m not sure minimal is such a complimentary term, but I&rsquo;ll accept it. I wasn&rsquo;t always minimal. In the early days I was laying it on as thickly as I could, trying very hard to get it right. But I found that the harder I tried, the more tired whatever it was I was working on looked. And then I grew tired of it as well.<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;There is too much sweat in it,&rdquo; is how my friend, the artist Vladimir Radunsky, would put it.&#160;<br> &#160;<br> Perhaps he means that there has been an imposition of too much of my will upon the material with which I was working. It is an offhand remark of Wordsworth&rsquo;s that helped me when I needed a new way to move forward: &ldquo;The matter always comes out of the manner.&rdquo; How you say something has direct bearing on what you say.<br> &#160;<br> So, if you labor heavily upon a work of art, then part of what you are saying is, this is a heavy work of art. If you happen to be trying to say something about lightness, then the art should be light as well.<br> &#160;<br> It is much the same with food. There are heavy meals and light meals. There are sauces that contain endless lists of ingredients, and there are sauces that contain only a few but in exquisite proportion. Does an apple taste best bitten directly into, sliced thinly with a light squeeze of lemon, or baked for an hour with nutmeg, sugar, cinnamon, flour and egg whites? Maybe the answer is that there is a time for all of those things.<br> &#160;<br> My answer in my illustration has been to allow the materials to speak as directly as possible. I want each and every entire brushstroke to be seen. I want the marks made by the tip of the brush to carry as much meaning as the marks made by the dragging tail end, the part that splits open as the paint pulls away, thins and dries. I want each brushstroke to have a beginning, a middle, and an end, a story in itself and a life in itself. Then the life of this brushstroke can wrestle with the life of the brushstroke next to it. There is enough action there between two brushstrokes for a little story. And what happens when the next brushstroke comes in a different color?&#160;<br> &#160;<br> It could be epic. Of course, if it&rsquo;s just brushstrokes wrestling around, it isn&rsquo;t much of a picture book is it? There still has to be a picture. And maybe it needs to be a picture of a dog named Daisy or a little girl riding a bike. So I have to be careful before I get too carried away in the manner itself.<br> &#160;<br> In the end, this is how it goes in my books. There are always two stories happening: one is me having fun watching brushstrokes wrestle, and the other is the story told in pictures and words on a page. It may be minimal, but it&rsquo;s enough for me."

Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t let my poor academic performance dissuade me from accomplishing my lifelong dreams.&quot;--Meghan McCarthy</i><br><br>Meghan McCarthy is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design and lives in Brooklyn, NY.<br><br><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</b><br><br>I was a wild child and barely stayed stationary for more than a minute, according to my mother. I grew up in a small town in Rhode Island called Clayville, which at the time, was comprised of about 200 people, trees, lakes, grass, dirt roads, and more trees. There wasn&#8217;t much to do and there weren&#8217;t many kids to play with. My kindergarten class consisted of only 12 kids. To make matters worse, my sister vomited on the back of the<br>family television one day, when I was about five. That tragic event was a catalyst for my parents&#8217; monumental decision&#8212;&#8212;no TV. From that day forward, my sister and I were to entertain ourselves.<br><br>For over a year, the family television sat useless and dusty. It was, however, resurrected after our toothless, 1950s-truck-driving, lawnmower-loving neighbor couldn't stand our cultural oppression any longer. During dinner one night, Mr. Parker stormed through the dining room, into the living room, and absconded out the back door with the TV. He brought it back a week later&#8212;&#8212;repaired&#8212;&#8212;much to my parents&#8217; dismay. But by that time, it was too late. I didn&#8217;t care to watch TV. I had more important things to do.<br><br>A few of those &#8220;important&#8221; things included inventing a flying machine, jumping off the garage roof with an umbrella, and publishing a children&#8217;s book. I never did finish the flying machine&#8212;&#8212;I think my father eventually dismantled the metal pieces and put them<br>out with the trash. I did jump off the garage roof and, thankfully, landed in one piece. And as for the children&#8217;s book, well, that didn&#8217;t happen right away. I hit a few speed-bumps.<br><br>One of those speed-bumps was encountered early on. My elementary school teachers often lectured &#8220;Meghan, pay attention,&#8221; and &#8220;Meghan, stop daydreaming,&#8221; and &#8220;Meghan, doodling is not important.&#8221;  I was great at painting and gluing and sculpting. I was terrible at reading and math and paying attention. Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t let my poor academic performance dissuade me from accomplishing my lifelong dreams.<br><br>I continued to draw, paint, and write stories throughout my high school years&#8212;&#8212;often while sitting in math class. Although I kept hitting those all too familiar speed-bumps, my hard work got me into art school. Thankfully, the Rhode Island School of Design didn&#8217;t care about my math grades! <br><br>After art school, I moved to New York City, population of more than 8 million&#8212;&#8212;a far cry from little old Clayville. I moved to New York to get a children&#8217;s book published and I wasn&#8217;t going to leave until I did it! Despite the culture shock, I adjusted.<br><br>I&#8217;d like to say I&#8217;ve changed a lot since the Clayville years. I&#8217;ve hopefully matured. I can actually finish an entire novel from front to back and can even balance my checkbook. But, somehow, I haven&#8217;t changed that much. My head is still in the clouds. I still have a few lifelong dreams to accomplish, such as being a lounge singer and jumping out of a plane, but my most unattainable dream has been attained.<br><br>That kid who swore she could fly by simply flapping her arms is still lurking. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a children&#8217;s book author, and it&#8217;s the perfect job for me."

I have to write books which at least have the potential to effect changes . . .&quot;</i>--L. S. Matthews<b><i><br><br></i></b>L. S. Matthews is the winner of the Fidler Award for her book<i> Fish</i>, an award given for a first novel for children. She lives and writes in England.<b><i><br></i><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><i><br>How I write:<br></i></b>When I wrote <i>Fish</i>, it was based on a dream I had. I woke up and thought (as you would, if you had a dream like &#8220;Fish&#8221;), what was all <i>that</i> about? I thought about it, and it seemed to start making a kind of sense. I think I had to put the events in order, as parts of the story appeared in flashback sequence in the dream. I am not sure, but I think I continued to dream other parts of the story later.<br><br>There is no sensible time, as an adult with responsibilities, to sit about writing stories, but I wrote <i>Fish</i> at a particularly silly time. I had two children, knew I had to sell my house, but had no idea where we were going to live, or how we could afford it - I had just walked away from three terms of strenuous teacher training.<br><br>With all these pressures on me, I watched news footage of determined and courageous refugees on television, and went off to bed, worrying about, of <i>all </i>things, how I would transport the three Koi Carp from our pond without distressing them, and to where?<br><br>All my writing seems to happen like this - it works from dreams; in the daytime, I correct and alter and move it around in my head till it seems to make sense; I don&#8217;t write anything down; and by the time I come to write, I know it pretty well and have got rid of all the worst mistakes. Because it&#8217;s hard to keep a whole book in your head and keep running through it to make sure you don&#8217;t forget, I&#8217;m very keen to get it down. I touch type (I was forced to learn how in my first job) so, having worked on a book in my head for maybe six months, I can have the first draft out in two to four weeks, because I am just typing out a story I have already written. I like to do this outside as much as possible, otherwise I get miserable from being inside too much. With <i>Fish</i>, I typed for 12 hours a day sometimes, in this very brief period; I calmed down a little with my second book. <br><br>I like to work like this because when it&#8217;s in your head it is easy to just rip out a chapter or move something to a different part of the story - no retyping time and time again!<br>When I was a child and had scary dreams, I learned to manipulate them, to control the events. I think this plays a part in the way my dreams form the stories to my books.<br><br><b><i>Where do you get your ideas for characters, settings, events? </i><br></b>All of my characters have different parts of my personality in them, I suppose, and parts of people I have known.<br><br>Events - well, I have never battled through a war-torn zone, but I came across a body when I was ten or so, and therefore I could write about Tiger&#8217;s feelings, sitting by the body of the young man who was shot.<br><br>I grew up the youngest of a family of five children; both of our parents worked full time and the house had a long garden which backed onto a wild area of land . . . much of my time was spent scrambling about, making camps, coming home filthy and scratched, but happy. I had two older brothers and singularly failed to notice that girls should be different until people started telling me so at about the age of 12. I had already noticed something was up when I was sent to our local school at 7, and didn&#8217;t get to play cricket and football like at home, but was pushed into a collection of people who played netball and rounders . . . hence the issue - or lack of it! - of Tiger&#8217;s gender in Fish. Some people still don&#8217;t get it. They say, &#8220;I thought it was a girl/boy&#8221; and then ask, &#8220;Well, which was it then? What was Tiger supposed to be?&#8221;<br><br>I answer: &#8220;Tiger&#8217;s not <i>supposed </i>to be anything.&#8221;<br><br>Then they say, &#8220;Yes, but what did you write it as? Girl or boy?&#8221; Just as they are sure there is an answer, I am equally fascinated by the fact they think it matters.<br><br><b><i>Animals (including fish and  birds) are important in my books because:<br></i></b>They may appear in the story at a moment which makes them symbolic, but they&#8217;re real too.<br><br>I communicated with animals probably before I could walk or talk; they were just different kinds of &#8220;peoples&#8221; to me then. I am more likely to notice a small bird hidden in a hedge than a human passing in full view and I still find it hard sometimes to concentrate on a human conversation when an animal is talking at the same time.<br><br><b><i>What motivates me to write?<br></i></b>It gets things out of my system, things that I am cross about, and maybe I can&#8217;t put everything right, but I can say to the world, &#8220;What about this? This is not good enough.&#8221; And to readers who may not have been fully aware: &#8220;This is reality, I know you&#8217;d rather think it has nothing to do with you.&#8221; But at the same time I can show the inspirational qualities of people . . . I am angry at what they are put through, but their courage and determination is something to admire, and only tends to be shown when tested to the limit. It puts my own worries, and my own abilities to cope, in proportion. I wouldn&#8217;t write a book which didn&#8217;t challenge the reader with questions which maybe aren&#8217;t easily answered. I have to write books which at least have the <i>potential</i> to effect changes . . ."

He is a former professor of history at California State University.<br><br><br><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><br></b>Being a writer is one of the great achievements of my life. As a teenager growing up in Detroit, Michigan, I hated school, all my teachers, and learning in general. When I was expelled from high school at the age of seventeen for fighting, I had passed two units&#8212;one in woodshop and one in gym. In bidding me farewell, my counselor fired his last shot at my self&#8217;-esteem: &#8220;Stanley,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re so dumb you couldn&#8217;t finish school even if you tried.&#8221;<br><br>It has taken a lot to prove him wrong. I joined the Air Force to get away from home and after a few years started taking correspondence courses through the mail. During the day I drove bulldozers and forklifts, and at night I learned how to write a complete sentence. I was twenty-one when I finally received my diploma from high school, which was somewhere near the base but which I never saw or visited. I was playing drums in a rock-&#8217;n&#8217;-roll band when I left the service and enrolled in junior college. This was the turning point in my life: not what I learned there, but getting the nerve to enroll.<br><br>I was the model insecure student, as hardly a day passed without my remembering, &#8220;Stanley, you&#8217;re so dumb. . . .&#8221; I can look back now with amusement and laughter at some of the things I did. For example, when I was registering on the first day, standing in a long line to get past this one station, a woman asked, &#8220;What do you think your major will be?&#8221; I had no idea of what she meant by &#8220;major,&#8221; but the girl in front of me said &#8220;English&#8221; and that got her through, so I said &#8220;English&#8221; (whatever that was) too. A month or so later, while talking about the upcoming midterm (my first), the teacher said, &#8220;Blue books are required. You can&#8217;t take the midterm without a blue book.&#8221; I spent nearly an hour in the library looking for the blue books&#8212;in the card catalog under blue, in the periodicals&#8212;until a kind reference librarian told me, without snickering, that they were in the bookstore. Though amusing now, when these things happened to me, they were proof that I would be found out: <i>I don&#8217;t belong here.<br><br></i>Fearing failure, I became an overachiever. I overstudied every subject, and wrote and rewrote each term paper before finally relinquishing it. But I still lived in doubt from one grade report to the next. Making the dean&#8217;s list, graduating from junior college with honors, and being invited to join an honor society all gave me tremendous confidence&#8212;for about a day, before the old demon of self-defeat reemerged. Nevertheless, I made my second big decision and enrolled in a state university. At least I now knew what a major was, and I proclaimed &#8220;History,&#8221; but the most enduring memory of my first few weeks there was learning how to spell <i>university</i> (in case I suddenly had to).<br><br>When it became clear that I would get my bachelor&#8217;s degree cum laude, I vowed to continue my education until they kicked me out or until there were no other degrees to earn, whichever came first. This was the easiest decision because it came last and not because I had unshakable confidence in my ability to do graduate work. Looking back, I now see that I was not ready for school when my counselor committed that great crime against me by calling me stupid. The hardest decision was the first time I tried to prove him wrong by enrolling in junior college and showing up for my first class quite literally trembling in my chair.<br><br>Before the university said that&#8217;s it, I earned a Ph.D. and a Phi Beta Kappa key and was lucky to secure a teaching position at a university where I was forced to think about becoming a writer to keep my job. I wrote scholarly articles and book reviews and delivered papers at professional conferences, which led to promotion as full Professor of History with tenure. Only then did I start thinking about becoming a writer in the sense of communicating with a wide audience by using language that could be understood. I would be lying, however, if I said I know why I became a writer. My best guess is that I became a writer because I had to&#8212;I&#8217;m not happy unless I&#8217;m writing something.<br><br>I started writing magazine articles, which gave me the experience I needed to write books. I wrote fishing articles, human interest stories, and accounts of things that had happened to me that were unusual or amusing. For instance, while attending college, I lived above a funeral parlor for three years; I wrote about my humorous&#8212;and chilling&#8212;experiences there in <i>Nightlife in the House of the Dead: Notes from the Second Floor.</i> I had a heart attack and an out-of-body experience and wrote about that also. All of this gave me experience in writing for different audiences. I did not sell everything I wrote, but that was okay, because I&#8217;ve learned there&#8217;s no such thing as wasted writing or bad writing. All writing leads to better writing.<br><br>Because I&#8217;m a historian, nonfiction writing has always been more interesting to me than fiction; and because of my background, I&#8217;m drawn to topics where people overcome adversity and empower themselves. <i>Children of the Dust Bowl</i> is a good example of this; I can identify with the Okie children who were kicked out of school because they were considered too dumb to learn but who, nevertheless, built their own school, got an education, and went on to succeed with their lives. Similarly, <i>I Am an American</i> is about a group of people who suffered injustice and still struggled against the inequity of ignorance and of prejudice.<br><br>The time that I have to write is determined by my teaching schedule, except in the summer, when I divide my days between fishing and writing. I teach courses in California history, the American West, and Native Americans and California Indians, usually three days a week, leaving three days open for writing and Sundays for racquetball, the family, and chores. I need at least four hours to do any serious writing, and other things must be in place: a Xerox photo of my subject affixed to the wall, where I can readily see it, the research notes for the day arranged in neat order, and a copy of my last book resting on the pages of my new book. Before I write, I have to read the last few pages I&#8217;ve written&#8212;to prove I <i>can</i> do it because I have done it.<br><br>If in four hours I can write two to five pages that can say exactly what I want to say, I&#8217;m happy. But beyond that, I&#8217;m not sure what it takes to be a writer. For me, good writing requires good thinking, and good thinking requires good reading, plus research. The other thing I suspect about writing is that probably anyone can do it if they work at it long enough and hard enough. I&#8217;m the proof.<br><br><br><b>PRAISE<br><br></b>HURRY FREEDOM<br>&#8220;A fine addition.&#8221;&#8212;<i>School Library Journal<br><br><br></i>I AM AN AMERICAN<br><i>A True Story of Japanese Internment <br><br></i>&#8212;A <i>School Library Journal </i>Best Book of the Year<br>&#8212;A <i>Horn Book </i>Fanfare<br>&#8212;An ALA Notable Children&#8217;s Book<br><br>&#8220;This eloquent account of the disastrous results of racial prejudice stands as a reminder to us in today's pluralistic society.&#8221;&#8212;Starred, <i>School Library Journal<br><br><br></i>CHILDREN OF THE DUST BOWL<br><i>The True Story of the School at Weedpatch Camp<br><br></i>&#8212;An ALA Notable Children&#8217;s Book<br>&#8212;A <i>Booklist </i>Editors&#8217; Choice <br>&#8212;A <i>Horn Book </i>Fanfare Honor Book<br>&#8212;A Notable Children&#8217;s Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies<br>&#8212;A Library of Congress Book of the Year <br>&#8212;A Jefferson Cup Award Winner (Virginia Library Association)<br>&#8212;A John and Patricia Beatty Award Winner (California Library Association)<br>&#8212;An NCTE Orbis Pictus Award Winner<br><br>&#8220;The story is inspiring, and Stanley has recorded the details with passion and dignity.

I had finished a middle-grade novel, <i>The World&#8217;s Most Disgusting Sandwich</i>, and was trying to get it published.<br>&#8220;It has potential,&#8221; a potential agent told me. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to see other books you&#8217;ve written.&#8221;<br>Other books I&#8217;d written? I hadn&#8217;t written any other books. I had written an anonymous poetry column for a teachers&#8217; newsletter. I had written a bunch of essays in college and graduate school. I had written some irreverent songs to play on my guitar. &#8220;This is my first book,&#8221; I confessed. <br>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t typically represent books, we represent writers. Are you working on something else?&#8221;<br>I had started on a sequel and began to tell her about it.<br>&#8220;I mean something different,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to see what else you can do.&#8221;<br>Oh, crap. &#8220;I have a few other ideas,&#8221; I said. <br>She told me when I had something written she&#8217;d be happy to take a look.<br>So I came up with a new idea in a hurry and started writing the fictional memoir of Zeke Zagger, the world&#8217;s greatest super villain that nobody had ever heard of. It was supposed to be funny; instead it was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful. Reading over the first 20 pages, I began to worry about the state of my subconscious. <br><br>So I decided to try again with a new character, and the first thing I wanted to do was give him a name. Shakespeare. Shakespeare Shapiro. Wow, I thought, imagine being that kid. So I did imagine it, and I started to vent on paper. It turned out Shakespeare Shapiro had a lot to say, not just about his name, but also about his crazy parents, his maddeningly popular younger brother, his social ineptitude, and the overall catastrophe of his life. Much of what he said was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful; but it was also really funny to me. And I guess it was funny to other people, too, because <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is set to hit the bookstores on September 25, 2007.<br><br>As an eighth-grade teacher, it is both incredibly exciting and a little bit nerve wracking to have written a book that I know my students&#8211;and probably their parents&#8211;will read. I&#8217;m excited to become a minor celebrity for the first time in my life, at least within the walls of Manhattan&#8217;s Middle School 255. I&#8217;m excited that my students will see me as a real live writer, and I will be thrilled if more of them are inspired to carry on independent writing lives. But I wonder how they and their parents will react to the fact that the book deals so openly with the kinds of things teenage boys think about. Just imagine parent-teacher conferences, if you will: <br> <br><b>PARENT #1</b>: So, Jake, we read your book.<br><br><b>ME</b> (<i>smiling nervously)</i>: Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you how Becky is doing in class. Her writing is&#8211;<br><br><b>PARENT #2 </b><i>(holding up a copy)</i>: Masturbation. Drug use. Pornography. You seem quite well versed in these subjects . . .<br><br>You get the idea. So to the question of how much of <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is autobiographical, let me just say that nothing has ever been proven. And as to the rumors that I&#8217;m now working on a musical called <i>Castration Celebration</i>, I&#8217;ll have to plead the fifth."

990,False,Jennifer Lynn,Jennifer Lynn Barnes,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/69151,Barnes,False,"I&#8217;ve wanted to be a writer for pretty much as long as I can remember. In fact, aside from a brief flirtation with the idea of being a veterinarian when I was four, being a professional writer has been my ultimate dream job (and, for that matter, my ultimate dream) for more or less my entire life. Along with my dislike of chocolate (I know, I&#8217;m a freak) and my love of all things sparkly, my passion for fiction&#8211;books, television, movies, and more&#8211;has probably been one of my most enduring character traits, and one of the ones that has most defined me as a person.<br><br>The summer I was 19, I wrote <i>Golden</i>, the story of a girl named Lissy who moves cross-country and lands right smack dab in the middle of the world&#8217;s scariest and most intimidating high school social hierarchy. Like Lissy, I changed schools at the start of my high school career. Unlike Lissy, however, I had to find my place at my new school without the aid of any kind of supernatural power.<br><br>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with the supernatural. When I was little, I used to watch <i>Bewitched</i> on television and wonder why it didn&#8217;t work when I twitched my own nose. In the third grade, I read Roald Dahl&#8217;s <i>Matilda</i> and spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to move things with the power of my mind. I love mythology, fairy tales, ghost stories, and the idea that there might be more out there than any of us can logically explain.<br><br>When I sit down to write a book, I usually start out with a supernatural concept&#8211;like aura vision or the idea of mystical tattoos capable of giving their wearers super powers&#8211;and then I think about my own experiences in life and try to identify an aspect of teen experience that fits with that particular slice of the supernatural. In <i>Golden</i>, Lissy&#8217;s ability to see auras gives her insight into the behavior of others, so I chose to throw her into the world of high school cliques, where her power would be both a blessing and a curse. <br><br>All of my characters lead double lives as normal teens in the every day teen world that have to deal with some pretty fantastical things. In many ways, I relate. Not because I have powers of my own (sadly, if I do have any super powers, they are as yet unidentified), but because throughout college, I lived my own double life&#8211;as a novelist and a student. I loved Yale, and didn&#8217;t want to miss out on any of my four years there, so more often than not, I was a college student by day and a writer by night, doing most of my writing between two and four in the morning, after everyone else had gone to sleep.<br><br>I&#8217;m a big believer that a writer has to be, first and foremost, a person who is out there in the world, experiencing life, and that is exactly what I try to do."

997,False,Eileen,Eileen Spinelli,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/72956,Spinelli,False,"I, Jerry Spinelli, am writing this myself without help from my wife and fellow author, Eileen, because I need to do some bragging about her. It was her idea that led to our first book together: <i>Today I Will</i>. She remembered reading daily devotionals, and it occurred to her that young readers might like a day-by-day book based on literature.<br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;There's a page in <i>Today I Will</i> for every day in the year&mdash;that&rsquo;s 366 pages/days, including leap year. Each page starts with a quote from children's or young adult literature. Then comes a commentary on the quote, followed by a resolution&mdash;that is, how you can apply the message to your day. The idea is that you take a minute to read the day's page when you get up in the morning. It helps to give your day a little direction.<br>&#160;&#160;<br><i>&#160;Today I Will </i>is just the latest in a long parade of ideas that Eileen has blessed me with. The sequel to <i>Stargirl</i>&mdash;<i>Love, Stargirl</i>&mdash;is one. The <i>Stargirl Journal </i>is another. &#160;<br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;Speaking of <i>Stargirl,</i> I guess you could say she gave me the idea for that one too, even though she never realized it. Listening to her talk about her childhood over the years, and getting to know this special person I happen to be married to, I found myself using Eileen again and again as my model as I developed the character of Susan Caraway, who names herself Stargirl. Two examples: Stargirl keeps notes on other people, so she knows when their birthdays are, what they like to eat, etc; and Stargirl has a &ldquo;happy wagon.&rdquo; I lifted both of these features from Eileen&rsquo;s personal history.<br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;She does more than supply me with ideas. She&rsquo;s my first reader and editor. When I finish a chapter, I put it on her desk. (We each have an office in our house.) She tells me if it&rsquo;s good (I go, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;) or not (I re-write). I do the same for her. It works so well for us, I sometimes wonder how any author can manage without a writing spouse. <br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;Sometimes we get asked: &ldquo;Do you compete with each other?&rdquo; The question always surprises us. The fact is, we are each other&rsquo;s biggest cheerleader. If Eileen writes a bestseller, I&rsquo;m probably happier about it than she is. There are no losers in our house.<br>&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;People who know we have seventeen grandchildren (at last count) often want to know if we get ideas from them. The answer is: Yes, we do. But there are many more sources to get stories from. We get story ideas from each other and from reading the newspaper and from memories of our own kidhoods and just from ordinary everyday life. &#160;<br>&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;With all this writing stuff going on in our House of Two Authors, you might wonder that it took us this long to write a book together. Actually, we did try it once before, years ago. It was a story about ideas in the form of cute, furry little creatures running around the house. That story was one idea we could have done without. It flopped."
