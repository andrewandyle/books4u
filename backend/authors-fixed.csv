I think I must have thought that books were born on the library shelves. But I was good at writing stories, and I had a good deal of practice.<br><br>My primary school teacher came in every Monday morning in the worst of moods. 'Fetch my bag'. He'd lay his leather strap across the front of his desk as a threat or warning. Then he'd turn and chalk up three titles on the board: <i>A Day in the Life of a Lost Umbrella, My Best Friend, The Worst</i> <i>Advice I</i> <i>ever Took</i>; anything like that. Then: 'I want absolute silence till break-time' he'd say, nursing his hungover head. 'The first person to whisper gets the strap'.<br><br>I loved those double lessons more than anything in the world (except for reading). No endless discussions. No sharing of ideas. No realising that someone else had also had your brilliant idea. I covered reams of paper. I wrote fast. And I learned to judge the form and the length of a story. It was the best training I could ever have had, though I didn't know I'd be a writer.<br><br>I still work with a pencil and rubber in absolute silence. I still hide my work with my arms if anyone walks past, and I wouldn't dream of talking about what I'm writing or let a soul look at it until it's completely finished. Oh - and I still prefer reading other people's books to writing my own!<br><br>A lot of my work, even for fairly young readers, raises quite serious social issues. I believe that many personal decisions have a social or political resonance, and the way people try to pick their way through tricky family situations interests me. But people won't (and shouldn't) read books that don't hold their interest, and I still adore funny books. So since I write for the reader inside myself, I always end up with the kind of book I would have loved to read (if only someone else had bothered to write for me)."

It was, for me, a terrible violation of privacy.<br><br>Like so many passionate readers, I decided to try to write a book of my own&ndash;to open one of those magical doors myself. It turned out to be very hard. The door did not spring open at my touch the way I'd secretly hoped it would. The knob was greasy and the frame had swelled in the heat.

And those images kept me from giving up.<br><br>The wonderful thing about writing fiction is that you can be inspired by the real world without being limited by its facts. You are allowed to imagine and embellish (particularly when one of your main characters inhabits an invented world of ice). I decided that my story took place in Greenland, where dog sledding is part of everyday life, and suddenly I had a cast of dogs. I discovered that a glacier could conceal a freshwater lake. I read about fireflies and learned that their&#160;light is&#160;triggered by oxygen. A glaciologist told me how to scare a polar bear with a flare gun, and why he loved his bread maker.

Which is sort of akin to the process of being a human being, even if you aren&#8217;t a writer. . . . And seriously, what is writing, other than telling stories about being a human being?&quot;--Daniel Ehrenhaft</i><br><br><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br><br><br>If there&#8217;s one thing you can say about Daniel Ehrenhaft&#8211;aside from the fact that he&#8217;s worn the same corduroys for the past eleven years&#8211;it&#8217;s that he has a difficult time writing about himself.  So when Random House asked him to contribute a little autobiography for this Website, he was naturally apprehensive.  <br><br>At first, he decided to do some research on the subject of autobiography.  He referred to this very site to read what other Random House authors had written about themselves.  It didn&#8217;t help.  For starters, he discovered that all these authors led fascinating, productive lives. To make matters worse, they all offered trenchant insight about what it means to be a writer. <br><br>As far as Mr. Ehrenhaft can tell, his own life as a writer boils down to a six-part regimen:<br><br>1) Drinking cheap coffee<br>2) Procrastinating (fiddling with the stereo, playing air guitar, etc.)<br>3) Reading a lot. Often, he&#8217;ll read something brilliant or moving or hilarious by someone he&#8217;s never read before, someone whose words end up blowing his mind&#8211;which is followed by<br>4) Jealousy and panic <br>5) Lunch  <br>6) A nap<br><br>But, in a strange way, this process does eventually inspire him to put pen to paper. (Or his fingertips to the computer keyboard, as it were.) After all, he knows what it&#8217;s like to be scared, and to put things off, and to worry about opening up to perfect strangers.  Which is sort of akin to the process of being a human being, even if you aren&#8217;t a writer. <br><br>And seriously, what <i>is</i> writing, other than telling stories about being a human being?  If that sounds evasive and simplistic&#8230;well, maybe it is.  On the other hand, that&#8217;s probably why a lot of writers do what they do.  They open up in their stories in ways that&#8211;at their best&#8211;illuminate truths and complexities not only about themselves, but about their readers, as well.  They write precisely so they don&#8217;t have to be evasive, which is what makes reading such a blast.  <br><br>So really, Daniel Ehrenhaft just writes because he loves to read, and he aspires to do what all his favorite authors have done for him.  In fact, if he had it his way, he would get <i>paid</i> to read.  Then again, if he had it his way, he and his wife would live in a huge castle with a billiards room and a pool shaped like a figure eight, and a custom-made electric guitar signed by the surviving members of The Clash.  <br><br>Until that happens, though, he&#8217;ll probably keep writing."

Snyder attended Whittier College in Southern California, which awarded her an honorary doctorate. There she also met her future husband, Larry Snyder. While ultimately planning to be a writer, after graduation Snyder decided to teach school temporarily. But she found teaching to be an extremely rewarding experience and taught in the upper elementary grades for a total of nine years, three of them as a master teacher for the University of California at Berkeley.&nbsp;

In the early sixties, when all of her children were finally in school, Snyder began to think about writing again. &ldquo;Writing for children hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me when I was younger, but nine years of teaching in the upper elementary grades had given me a deep appreciation of the gifts and graces that are specific to individuals with 10 or 11 years of experience as human beings. Remembering a dream I&rsquo;d had when I was 12 years old about some strange and wonderful horses, I sat down and began to write.&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>Season of Ponies</i>, Snyder&rsquo;s first book, was published in 1964.

Snyder&rsquo;s novel,&nbsp;<i>Gib Rides Home</i>, is a vivid look at the life of an orphan in prairie country almost a century ago. The book was inspired by Snyder&rsquo;s father, who grew up in a Nebraska orphanage and was farmed out as labor on nearby ranches."

87,True,Barbara,Barbara Hall,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/11573,Hall,False,"I am a curious creature. In some ways, I am still a small-town Southern woman, only now I live in Los Angeles. I have also spent a great deal of time in England and New York City. I write books and I play in a band and I&#8217;m Catholic. I am also a producer and writer for television. I am a mother and I hang out with surfers and I like motorcycles (though I don&#8217;t drive one) and I turn my music up very loud.<br><br>I like to read. When I came across the quote in which Albert Einstein claimed he was not particularly intelligent, just passionately curious, I was greatly relieved. I no longer had to be eccentric, stubborn, or complicated or have ADD&#8211;I could be passionately curious. If only I had known this when I was a teenager! Back then, I looked a little bit crazy to my family and to the inhabitants of the town where I grew up. I was the youngest of three kids and I didn&#8217;t follow in any of my siblings&#8217; footsteps.<br><br>I did all kinds of things in my quest to have adventures, but I lived in a small town, so my efforts were limited. I taught myself to play the guitar. I stole rides with boys on minibikes. I wrote long letters to local DJs, getting them to play my song requests and to read my thoughts on the air. I wrote poems and sent them off to magazines. I was published at fourteen and again at fifteen, at which time I was also paid ten dollars. It was the beginning of my life as a professional writer. It wasn&#8217;t until after I had moved away from home that I began to understand how growing up in the South had shaped my personality as well as my voice as a writer. <br><br>I had a strong desire to talk about how circumstances are handed down through the generations. It doesn&#8217;t mean that people are doomed by their circumstances. It does mean that people, even young people, have to recognize where and what they come from, and in some instances, they have to do a certain amount of work to overcome it. The South has had to overcome the burden of slavery. It is a problem they brought upon themselves, and there is still a price to be paid. Such a burden often falls on children: we have to clean up the mess our ancestors made, much as young people today will have to help clean up what generations before have done to the environment.<br><br>I believe that few people understand the South very well these days. I have a fifteen-year-old daughter, and I notice how she is taught about it in school. They brush past the Civil War, and no one talks about the South much because no one really cares about the losers. The Civil War was not only about slavery, it was also about state versus federal rights. The South wanted to rule itself badly enough to go to war; that gives you an idea of what a proud society it once was. One important part of history that had a great impact on my ancestors was the era of Reconstruction. That&#8217;s when the North tried to help the South put the pieces back together, but their efforts were not always admirable. It was a terrible period in our history, and people still remember it and talk about it. In <u>The Noah Confessions,</u> I decided to write a little bit about the Reconstruction in an effort to help myself and others understand how it affected my life.<br><br>Everything in the South is gothic. There is a heightened sense of drama carved out of a history of gentility and manners. Southerners turn small things into big ones; at the same time they deal stoically with larger matters. Insults are big on the scale; death is matter of fact. Southerners are not afraid of salt, grease, dirt, germs or alcohol. They are afraid of lawyers, doctors and pills. It still seems like a sound philosophy to me.<br><br>Secrets are big in the South, and they are often confused with privacy, which is how I ended up writing a book on that subject. Secrets create mystery; people who do not like to keep secrets or become the victims of them naturally become detectives in their own lives. Children should never be asked to keep secrets, particularly the secrets of their families.<br><br>Many aspects of my family were shrouded in mystery because the habit of secrecy was passed down over generations. When I would ask about my ancestors my mother would often say, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know much about that side,&#8221; or &#8220;You might want to be careful what you go digging for.&#8221; I don&#8217;t believe my family was aware of being secretive; I think they believed they were being private or minding their own business. The problem came when I, as a passionately curious person, needed to know more than I was allowed. And in some cases, more than I could handle.<br><br>The secrets revealed in <u>Noah</u> are much more dramatic than the ones I uncovered in my own life. But the dynamic is similar. Whenever I was told something that didn&#8217;t add up, getting to the truth became a dangerous mission that threatened my position in the family. Going a step further and talking about it granted me black sheep status from time to time. But there was no way to fully understand myself or my experience without knowing the history leading up to me. This is why I spent a lot of time later in life wading through both the story of my family and the story of the town I grew up in.<br><br>Much of the history of the South became lost or distorted because of the Civil War. During Reconstruction, the real secrets began. People had to hide things so that they wouldn&#8217;t be taken or stolen. Confederate money was worthless, so other valuables had to be buried. Property had to be disguised. In many cases, entire families were turned out on the streets, having lost everything to the war. And sometimes, oftentimes, people had to resort to illegal activities to survive. Bootlegging, smuggling, black market schemes, secret societies. Eventually the South regained its respectability by rebuilding proper industries. But for a while, for many families, the only way to survive was to live outside the rules.<br><br>The tradition of not airing your dirty laundry, or any other kind, was born from that particular time in history. If you look back far enough in almost any Southern family, you are going to find the black sheep who resorted to activities no one wants to discuss.<br><br>In <u>The Noah Confessions,</u> I wanted to write about a girl who is harboring an enormous secret and how that has stopped her from having a normal life. In this case, she&#8217;s afraid it will prevent her from ever being free or happy. She knows that her devotion to the truth has the power to alienate her from her entire family. She also knows it is her only salvation. I have always been interested in writing about teenagers who have to face choices like that. Even in <u>Joan of Arcadia,</u> I chose to write about a teenager with a mission so big that most adults couldn&#8217;t handle it.<br><br>I wanted to show the connections from one generation to the next and to validate the coming-of-age struggle, which is a struggle to understand your immediate environment and, at the same time, to put yourself in some kind of historical context. I believe it is the best way to discover your purpose&#8211;which is the most fascinating and worthwhile journey you can ever take. It is the song that never ends.<br><br>But what a song. Turn it up loud."

Basically, it&#8217;s like a multiple choice test except you have four choices and one of them is a total lie&#8211;the others are true&#8230;The point of the game is to figure out which one is a total lie . . . what&#8217;s that? You wish you could play right now? Well, goody because I think that&#8217;s much more fun than a dry bio&#8211;plus you could win big prizes (that&#8217;s a lie), but you&#8217;ll have the invigorating experience of being right. And really when it comes down to it, how can a new car beat being right? <br><br>We&#8217;ll start off easy to get you warmed up. First set: 1) Amber Kizer is my real name; 2) I live on an island; 3) I have a rooster named Fabio; 4) I have parakeets named Chirp and Pecker<br><br>Think you know which one is false? Say it out loud, no cheating! Ready? I do not have a penname, which means Amber Kizer is, in fact, my real name (although, I have considered writing under the name J.K. Rowling, just because it has such a catchy ring to it). I do live on an island. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not a gorgeous tropical island. It&#8217;s in the Pacific Northwest where gray skies and green trees (thanks to the rain!) are the most popular colors. I do have a rooster named Fabio. He is named after a very famous cover model for romance novels&#8211;the human Fabio is beefy, doesn&#8217;t own t-shirts, and has long blond hair he swings around seductively. The chicken Fabio isn&#8217;t beefy (tastes like chicken), doesn&#8217;t own t-shirts, and has long blond feathers, which he does indeed throw around like he&#8217;s in front of a wind machine. I do not have parakeets because I don&#8217;t like cages and in my mind having parakeets is one step away from wearing housecoats, lycra in public, and owning 50 cats, all named Sweetie. <br><br>It&#8217;s going to get harder . . . 1) I make wedding cakes for fun; 2) I love reality TV&#8211;especially dating shows; 3) I have four kids and am married; 4) I don&#8217;t miss a minute of March Madness basketball if I can help it.<br><br>Think you know? I do make wedding cakes for fun, and birthday cakes, and I love you cakes, and cakes of all kinds. I love to bake. If you want to see photos of cakes I&#8217;ve made just visit my Web site at AmberKizer.com. I do love reality TV&#8211;and especially dating shows, the raunchier it is, the funnier and the better it is. Please don&#8217;t hold this against me, I&#8217;m in therapy to break the addiction! I adore college hoops and try not to miss any of the tournaments&#8211;men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s. I&#8217;m not married and don&#8217;t have kids&#8211;I&#8217;m young and, while I do hope those things are in my future somewhere way down the line, they&#8217;re on the wish list rather than in the cart. I am, however, in stock and ready to ship. <br><br>All right, I&#8217;m done being nice to you. Here&#8217;s a hard one: 1) I read 15&#8212;20 books concurrently; 2) I quilt; 3) Roses are my favorite flower; 4) I collect amber jewelry when I travel.<br><br>I do read a huge, high stack of books all at the same time&#8211;it keeps it interesting. There&#8217;s too much to learn in the world to read one from start to finish. So I read a chapter, change books, read a chapter and so on, until whatever I&#8217;m reading is so compelling I have to finish the book. Pretty much any topic is game, but I stay away from math theory and computer programming because they just give me a headache. I do quilt&#8211;I love working with colors and fabrics. I don&#8217;t quilt as often as I&#8217;d like because these hands are usually wrung dry from typing, but yum, it feeds my creative soul to stitch fabrics together. Roses are a favorite, but my ultimate favorite flowers are lilies&#8211;Casablanca white ones, Stargazer pinks, any of the really fragrant lilies&#8211;the scent makes my soul smile. So that was kinda a trick one because, of course, I collect amber jewelry. I love it and it looks good with my coloring, so it&#8217;s a win win. <br><br>Now, to the super-duper difficult ones: 1) I&#8217;ve wanted to be a writer since I could talk; 2) I wrote my first book at the age of five called &#8220;Wiggle Me, Tiggle Me&#8221;; 3) I only write when my muse taps me on the shoulder; 4) I don&#8217;t have to do much editing; it&#8217;s usually close to perfect the first time around.<br><br>Think you know? Ha ha, changed it up&#8211;they&#8217;re all LIES! LIES, LIES, LIES! Okay, so maybe that wasn&#8217;t fair, but it was fun. I always wanted to be a criminal prosecuting attorney and eventually a Supreme Court Justice. (Can you spell <i>overachiever</i> anyone?) But I played basketball fervently, and over the course of high school, I ended up with some fairly nasty injuries to my feet and legs. Those led to surgeries, which then gave room to a rare nerve disorder. I developed symptoms at age 18 and it totally and completely sucks (just telling it like it is). In the simplest of terms, the system that controls pain signals, temperature, circulation, and all that very important stuff is corrupted to the point that it&#8217;s wrong all the time&#8211;which means my legs hurt all the time and don&#8217;t always work for me when I ask them to. So this means my life has to be fairly fluid&#8211;I can not tell you how many plans I&#8217;ve had to cancel, how many shows I&#8217;ve given away tickets to, how many great ideas I&#8217;ve had to say &#8220;sorry&#8221; to. I know someone loves me when I say I&#8217;m hurting and they show up with ice cream and a video when we were supposed to go out. This also means that I can&#8217;t count on my legs to have a structured 9 to 5 job (although I&#8217;d love to do any number of things on a consistent basis), so I had to figure out a career that was flexible and that I could do on the good days, or from a horizontal position on the bad ones. A friend invited me to a workshop she was giving on how to teach writing to kids. I did all the activities, and I was hooked on storytelling. I came away from that six weeks with six pages of a story. I wanted to know the ending, so I kept writing. <br><br>Oh, and I should probably tell you that I started in adult romances. Yes, that&#8217;s right, I <i>love</i> romances and they&#8217;re completely a hoot to write&#8211;a hopeless romantic, I adore happy endings and who doesn&#8217;t like hot, steamy, monkey s---socks. Monkey socks.  So I wrote one book, then another, then another. The whole time I was learning what I could about the craft&#8211;it&#8217;s like wanting to be a great artist you need to know the techniques and tools of the craft, and you have to practice. I also spent a great deal of time learning the business end of things&#8211;how agents work, how publishing works, what to expect, what to do right, and what to avoid doing at all costs. There&#8217;s so much to learn I&#8217;m convinced I will never know it all. But I worked my way up the scale from form letter rejections to handwritten notes to long, involved letters asking for revisions. <br><br>I was working on my fourth romance when a voice in my head started giving editorial input. &#8220;He put his hand where? That so wouldn&#8217;t happen . . . eeewww.&#8221; And on and on. Meet Gert. She had things to say and I desperately needed her to shut up, so I opened a new word document and went at it. I figured I&#8217;d let her go until she ran out of steam and then I could get back to the real writing. I guessed 20 pages tops before she ran out of things to say. That was 2005 and she&#8217;s still going. Nothing is off limits, she talks about everything&#8211;even the stuff parents hope their kids don&#8217;t know about. <i>One Butt Cheek</i> is the first in her series&#8211;the second <i>From Butt to Booty</i> comes out next fall.<br><br>I always edit. I always rewrite. And there are no such things as <i>muses</i> unless you use that as a synonym for <i>discipline</i> or <i>perseverance</i>. <br><br>My advice for anyone who thinks they want to be a writer is to hang glide. No, again that&#8217;s not the truth, but it sounds way more interesting than the truth, which is to . . . um . . . write. Also get good at surviving rejection because you have to. Because you have to put yourself out there all the time and learn how to shake it off and do it all over again the next day. You won&#8217;t get published if you don&#8217;t send it out. And you won&#8217;t get published if you send out crap that you haven&#8217;t perfected to the best of your ability. But it&#8217;s not easy, it&#8217;s not pain free and it&#8217;s not for the weak of spirit. It&#8217;s hard, competitive, and everyone thinks because they type out e-mails that writing a book can&#8217;t be much harder than that. Oh yeah, everyone thinks they could write the next bestseller without breaking a sweat, everyone thinks they&#8217;re a writer&#8211;just know that up front. <br><br>So here&#8217;s my advice&#8211;it&#8217;s really good practice to ask the cute boy out, call the girl who you&#8217;ve been crushing on since sixth grade, make yourself available and vulnerable. Because here&#8217;s the deal, they might say yes, they might have been enamored of you for ages, too. Because you could get the call that says, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a contract offer on your book!&#8221; Or at the very least you&#8217;ll have some soul-wrenching real-life experience to write about and that, my friends, is the truth and nothing but the truth. So help me Gert."

185,True,Rudy,Rudy Wiebe,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/33129,Wiebe,False,"Rudy Wiebe was born on October 4, 1934, in an isolated farm community of about 250 people in a rugged but lovely region near Fairholme, Saskatchewan. His parents had escaped Soviet Russia with five children in 1930, part of the last generation of homesteaders to settle the Canadian West, and part of a Mennonite history of displacement and emigration through Europe and Asia to North and South America since the seventeenth century. In 1947 his family gave up their bush farm and moved to Coaldale, Alberta, a town east of Lethbridge peopled largely by Ukrainians, Mennonites, Mormons, and Central Europeans, as well as Japanese, who ended up there during WW II.<br><br>Rudy Wiebe read as much as possible from an early age; his first reading materials were the Bible, the Eaton's catalogue and the <i>Free Press Weekly Prairie Farmer</i>; he also recalls listening to his parents&#8217; stories of Russia. By Grade 4, he had read through the two shelves of books available in the one-room schoolhouse. Growing up, he enjoyed <b>Les Miserables, Toilers of the Sea, David Copperfield, Tom Brown's Schooldays</b>, Greek myths and Norse legends. Later an admirer of Faulkner, M&#225;rquez, Borges and Tolstoy, Wiebe has always held to the fundamentals of plot, character and, above all, story. He believes stories should begin in the specific and local but expand into &#8220;a human truth larger than any individual.&#8221;<br><br>Wiebe won his first prize for fiction while studying literature at the University of Alberta, where he enrolled in a writing class and began producing poems, plays and stories. His winning story in a Canada-wide contest recounted a young boy&#8217;s response to the death of his sister &#8211; based on Wiebe&#8217;s own experience &#8211; and was published in the magazine <i>Liberty</i> in 1956. After earning his B.A., Wiebe left for the ancient University of T&#252;bingen in West Germany on a Rotary Fellowship to study literature and theology, an experience that increased his respect for older and richer communities. Tena Isaak of British Columbia joined him there and they were married. The couple travelled in England, Austria, Switzerland and Italy before returning to Edmonton, where Wiebe completed his M.A. in creative writing. His thesis grew into his first novel, <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b>. <br><br>In 1962 Wiebe earned a Bachelor of Theology degree from the Mennonite Brethren Bible College; he considered becoming a minister. He was editor of Winnipeg&#8217;s <i>Mennonite Brethren Herald</i> when <b>Peace Shall Destroy Many</b><i> </i>was published. Many conservative ministers and Mennonites in small towns objected to the novel's frank and at times unflattering portrait of community life, and there was considerable opposition to the book. &#8220;I wasn't exactly sacked as editor . . . but the committee came to me and said &#8216;Ahem.&#8217; I resigned.&#8221; The strength of this reaction made him think hard about the power of the written word, and reinforced his sense of wanting to be a writer.<br><br>Wiebe then was invited to teach at a Mennonite college in Goshen, an agricultural town in Indiana with a large Mennonite and Amish population, where he would be Assistant Professor of English from 1963 to 1967. Goshen College was a lively and stimulating intellectual community where Wiebe committed himself to writing, study, teaching and travel. &#8220;I encountered men and women of real perception . . . really literate Christians who saw themselves as Jesus's followers and at the same time were acquainted with the thoughts of others and had brought that kind of understanding to bear on what it means to be a Christian. The best thing that ever happened to me was the meetings we had every two or three weeks in one home or another &#8211; seven or eight of us, a psychiatrist, a couple of theologians, a couple of literary people. There were the best theologians there, I think, the Mennonite Church has ever had.&#8221; <br><br>Wiebe published his second novel, <b>First and Vital Candle</b>, and began to explore the western United States and the Mennonite settlements in Paraguay. He returned to Edmonton as a professor in creative writing and English at the University of Alberta, and immersed himself in Canadian literature. He wrote reviews, essays and articles, edited anthologies and was soon established as a major figure in Canadian letters. In 1973, his novel <b>The Temptations of Big Bear</b> won a Governor General's Award. Since then he has continued to win the highest praise for his books of fiction and non-fiction. He has written numerous film and television scripts, lectured internationally from Denmark to India, and given readings from Adelaide to Puerto Rico to Helsinki and Igloolik. For thirty years he taught literature and creative writing at colleges and universities in Canada, the United States and Germany. Now retired from teaching, his former students include such accomplished writers as Myrna Kostash, Aritha van Herk, Thomas Wharton and Katherine Govier.<br>  <br>Wiebe was called the first major Mennonite writer to place his community&#8217;s experience in a broader framework. Mennonites assert the fundamental authority of Scripture, especially the New Testament, as a practical guide to life. But while Wiebe imbues his work with a deep moral seriousness, his focus has always been on narrative. &#8220;I never consciously think of writing a so-called Christian novel. I don&#8217;t think Albert Camus ever thought of writing an existentialist novel, either. I think of getting at, of building, a story.&#8221; As a prairie writer, he has often concerned himself with Native stories, feeling place of birth to be more important than blood ancestry. &#8220;Those Mennonite villages in Russia are my heritage, but not my world. The world I feel and sense in my bones is the bush of northern Saskatchewan, of prairie Canada.&#8221; Native spirituality, with its vital links to the physical world, has always attracted him. But his fiction manages to transcend nationality and locale to explore the struggles of communities and individuals; his books and stories have been translated into nine European languages, as well as Chinese, Japanese and Hindi.<br><br>Whatever Wiebe&#8217;s focus in a given work, he has always chosen ambitious themes, and his work rewards readers with an intensity seldom rivalled. He is a voice of Canadian fiction that cannot be ignored, and whose work promises to endure."

The direction of the story is determined by the main character&#8217;s ambitions and reactions. The main character is the one to whom the readers will relate.&#8221;&#8212;Joan Lowery Nixon</i><br><br>Joan Lowery Nixon is the only four-time winner of the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe Award and a two-time winner of the California Young Reader Medal.<br><br><b><br>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</b><br><br>Whether it&#8217;s engrossing historical dramas, chilling mysteries, suspense-filled page-turners, or adventure stories, kids, teachers, and librarians love the books of Joan Lowery Nixon.<br><br>Nixon is half Californian, half Texan. She has a degree in journalism and credentials in elementary education. Nixon has written over 130 books for children from preschool age through young adult&#8212;including science books, co-authored with her husband, geologist Hershell Nixon. Her books have garnered numerous awards and accolades, including the Western Writers of America Golden Spur Award for Best Western Juvenile and the Texas Institute of Letters Award. Many of Nixon&#8217;s books have won state children&#8217;s choice awards. She is the only four-time winner of the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Juvenile Mystery. Nixon has four children and several grandchildren.<br><br>Nixon describes the pleasure she gets from writing mystery and suspense: &#8220;When I was young I discovered an evening radio program called <i>I Love a Mystery</i>. It was intriguing, suspenseful, and at times absolutely terrifying, and the title was correct. I <i>did</i> love a mystery&#8212;on radio, in films, and especially in books. Maybe I&#8217;m really a detective at heart because much later in my life, when I began to write books for young people, I discovered writing mysteries was even more fun than reading them.<br><br>&#8220;A mystery begins to develop in my mind when something sparks an idea and a question grows from it. What would it be like to move into a house in which a murder had taken place? How would I feel if my best friend were arrested for murder on circumstantial evidence? As a question develops into an answer, I give a great deal of thought to my main character. She is the most important part of the story, and I see it take shape through her eyes. Before I write a word of the story I know how I&#8217;ll begin it and how I&#8217;ll end it, making sure to put in honest clues and distracting red herrings&#8212;just to make the mystery all the more fun to solve. I love mysteries, and I want my readers to love them, too.&#8221;<br><br>In creating the acclaimed Orphan Train Adventures, Nixon explored a time and place in America&#8217;s recent past that is not widely covered in history lessons. She explains, &#8220;It was a part of history I hadn&#8217;t known: that beginning in 1854, over 100,000 homeless children were rescued from the streets of New York City and sent by train to new homes in the West. As I researched early journals, I found many letters&#8212;some hopeful, some sad&#8212;and reports which told of tears as brothers and sisters were separated or a child was not chosen. I wanted to bring history and fiction together in an exciting, adventurous time and place, to tell the stories of those who could have traveled west on the Orphan Train.&#8221;<br><br>Many of Nixon&#8217;s readers have written to her asking how to get published.

224,True,David Adams,David Adams Richards,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/25454,Richards,False,"Born in 1950 in Newcastle, New Brunswick, David Adams Richards was the third of William and Margaret Richards' six children. He found his calling at the age of fourteen, after reading <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and embarked on a life of extraordinary purpose, one which he says didn't help his finances: ""Sometimes .&#160;.&#160;. I thought it would be better if I were a plumber, but I wouldn't be very good.""<br><br>At the age of twenty and after finishing his first novel, <i>The Keeping of Gusties</i>, Richards went in search of a community of writers. His quest ended when he met a group of academics at the University of New Brunswick. Richards would hitch-hike from his home in Newcastle to Fredericton every Tuesday night to meet with them and read from his work. The literary evenings were held on campus at McCourt Hall, in an outbuilding formally used to store ice. The group quickly became known as the Ice House Gang. There he received encouragement from established writers, including the late Alden Nowlan, whom he names as important influences along with Faulkner, Pushkin, Dostoevsky and Emily Bront&euml;. It was during his time with these writers that Richards wrote two-thirds of his second novel, <i>The Coming of Winter</i>, which was published by Oberon Press in 1974.<br><br>In 1971, Richards married Peggy McIntyre. They spent the first years of their marriage travelling throughout Canada, Europe and Australia. It was on these long sojourns away from the Mirimachi that Richards found he could write about the home he loved, regardless of where he lived. As he continued to write, Richards took postings as writer-in-residence at universities in New Brunswick, Ontario, Alberta and at Hollins University in Roanoke, Virginia. In 1997, they moved to Toronto with their sons John Thomas and Anton.<br><br>The Miramichi region has continued as the heart of Richards' fiction throughout his career. As he explained in an interview with <i>January</i> <i>Magazine</i>, his connection to the area and to the rural lives of its inhabitants is central to his fiction, yet does not reflect a limited scope: ""It's very important, because the characters come from the soil. They're like the trees, in a certain respect. They cling to that river and that soil, but as Jack Hodgins once said about my writing&mdash;which was one of the kindest things any writer has said about my writing&mdash;he said: 'David, you aren't writing about the Miramichi Valley, you're writing about Campbell River where I come from. Because every character you talk about is a character I've met here in Campbell River.' And that's basically what I'm doing. Of course my people are Miramichi. Of course they come from the fabric and the soil of the Miramichi but if that was the only thing that was interesting about them, I wouldn't bother writing about them.""<br><br>The relocation to Toronto was not without its difficulties, though. As Richards documented in the memoir <i>Lines on the Water</i>, he loves fly-fishing on the Miramichi River. Yet once he was no longer a resident, he was unable to get a fishing licence for the region. Thankfully, said Richards, the local government proclaimed him an ""honorary Miramichier""&mdash;""So I can go fishing. It was very nice of them and very touching."" He has also written a non-fiction book on the place of hockey in the Canadian soul, called <i>Hockey Dreams</i>.<br><br>Richards has received numerous awards and prizes throughout his career. Most notably, he is one of few writers in the history of the Governor General's Literary Awards to win in both the fiction (<i>Nights Below Station Street</i>) and non-fiction (<i>Lines on the Water</i>) categories. In addition to these two wins, he was nominated for <i>Road to the Stilt House</i> (in 1985), <i>For Those Who Hunt the Wounded Down</i> (in 1993) and <i>Mercy Among the Children</i> (in 2000). Considered by many to be Richards' most accomplished novel, <i>Mercy</i> was co-winner of the Giller Award in 2000, and was shortlisted for the Trillium Award and the Thomas Raddell Award. It also won the Canadian Booksellers Association author of the year and fiction book of the year awards. Over the years, Richards has also won countless regional awards for his novels and was awarded the prestigious Canada-Australia Literary Prize in 1992. More recently,&#160;<i>The Lost Highway</i>&#160;was shortlisted for the Governor General&rsquo;s Literary Award and longlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and&#160;<i>The Friends of Meagre Fortune</i>&#160;won the Commonwealth Writers&rsquo; Prize for Best Book and was longlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize.&#160;<br><br>Despite all of these successes, it was years before Richards made money at writing. He laughs at the sales of his early work: ""For a long while if I sold 200 books, I'd be saying: Oh, great! And, you know, a $50 advance! That's great. I only worked three years, I don't know if I can spend $50.""<br><br>Also a screenwriter, Richards has adapted a number of his novels for the small screen. In 1990, he adapted his novel <i>Nights Below Station Street</i>, and in 1994 he penned the teleplay ""Small Gifts,"" for which he won his first Gemini. He won his second for his screen adaptation of <i>For Those Who Hunt the Wounded Down</i>, and later co-wrote the screenplay for<i> The Bay of Love and Sorrows</i>, released as a feature film in 2002.<br><br>In addition to his novels and non-fiction books, Richards' short stories and articles have been published in literary magazines and anthologies. His literary papers were acquired in 1994 by the University of New Brunswick."

I hadn&#8217;t written any other books. I had written an anonymous poetry column for a teachers&#8217; newsletter. I had written a bunch of essays in college and graduate school. I had written some irreverent songs to play on my guitar. &#8220;This is my first book,&#8221; I confessed. <br>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t typically represent books, we represent writers. Are you working on something else?&#8221;<br>I had started on a sequel and began to tell her about it.<br>&#8220;I mean something different,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to see what else you can do.&#8221;<br>Oh, crap. &#8220;I have a few other ideas,&#8221; I said. <br>She told me when I had something written she&#8217;d be happy to take a look.<br>So I came up with a new idea in a hurry and started writing the fictional memoir of Zeke Zagger, the world&#8217;s greatest super villain that nobody had ever heard of. It was supposed to be funny; instead it was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful. Reading over the first 20 pages, I began to worry about the state of my subconscious. <br><br>So I decided to try again with a new character, and the first thing I wanted to do was give him a name. Shakespeare. Shakespeare Shapiro. Wow, I thought, imagine being that kid. So I did imagine it, and I started to vent on paper. It turned out Shakespeare Shapiro had a lot to say, not just about his name, but also about his crazy parents, his maddeningly popular younger brother, his social ineptitude, and the overall catastrophe of his life. Much of what he said was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful; but it was also really funny to me. And I guess it was funny to other people, too, because <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is set to hit the bookstores on September 25, 2007.<br><br>As an eighth-grade teacher, it is both incredibly exciting and a little bit nerve wracking to have written a book that I know my students&#8211;and probably their parents&#8211;will read. I&#8217;m excited to become a minor celebrity for the first time in my life, at least within the walls of Manhattan&#8217;s Middle School 255. I&#8217;m excited that my students will see me as a real live writer, and I will be thrilled if more of them are inspired to carry on independent writing lives. But I wonder how they and their parents will react to the fact that the book deals so openly with the kinds of things teenage boys think about. Just imagine parent-teacher conferences, if you will: <br> <br><b>PARENT #1</b>: So, Jake, we read your book.<br><br><b>ME</b> (<i>smiling nervously)</i>: Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you how Becky is doing in class. Her writing is&#8211;<br><br><b>PARENT #2 </b><i>(holding up a copy)</i>: Masturbation. Drug use. Pornography. You seem quite well versed in these subjects . . .<br><br>You get the idea.

I do that a lot as a writer&mdash;challenge myself to try new things&mdash;and tackling a fairy tale was <i>definitely</i> a new thing. So how to begin?&#160;<br><br>I knew I wanted my story to have a classical feel, incorporating such wonderfully delicious fairy-tale elements as four-and-twenty blackbirds, enchanted forests, and hairy trolls. On the other hand, I wanted it to be totally original, a story like no other. I began writing, and within a few weeks had a tale. But let me tell you a curious truth about writers&mdash;they <i>are</i> the stories they write, the fictions they spin. And when I read back what I had written, I realized I had created a fairy tale about . . . <i>me</i>. Weird, but true! The story is filled with my favorite things&mdash;journeys and birthdays and cake. The princess, taking after my son Scott, is allergic to strawberries. And Jack? Just like me, he good-naturedly follows life&rsquo;s road, gathering experiences he can spin into tales.<br><br>Spinning experiences into tales is what I did with <i>The Fabled Fifth Graders of Aesop Elementary School</i>, too. I visit lots of school, and there&rsquo;s nothing I like better than talking with kids, watching them in the lunchroom or on the playground, reading their essays and stories, listening to them tell jokes. And all the while I&rsquo;m doing these things, I&rsquo;m thinking about how I can use them in a book. Let me give you an example. A few years ago, I was visiting a school in Tennessee when a fifth-grade boy came up to me and said, &ldquo;Look what I can do.&rdquo; He stuck out his tongue, crossed his eyes and wiggled his ears &ndash; first the left one, and then the right one. I was impressed&mdash;but I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything yet! Within seconds, the rest of the fifth graders surround me. Everyone, it seemed, had some special body trick to show me&mdash;double-jointed fingers and toes, eyelids that folded, lips that could be pulled up over noses, knuckles that cracked to the tune of &ldquo;Yankee Doodle.&rdquo; It was absurd and wonderful, and I knew I had to write about it.

I am, and always have been, from the &ldquo;Only Boring People Are Bored&rdquo; school of thought, and worked hard as a child to develop and use my imagination. One of my favorite experiences from that time of my life is when I decided I had a future in Hollywood. <br>&#160;<br>It practically kills me to admit this, but I got the idea from a made-for-TV movie on &ldquo;The Wonderful World of Disney,&rdquo; a Sunday evening staple in our home in Andover, Ohio.&#160; Johnny Whitacre, who was my age, starred in <i>The Mystery of Dracula&rsquo;s Castle, </i>in which his character makes a movie. I was nothing if not stubborn, and figured that if Johnny Whitacre could do it, so could I.&#160; And so, at thirteen, armed with my dad&rsquo;s 8-millimeter movie camera, some plastic fangs, and a few tubes of fake blood, I set out to make a horror movie.&#160; <br>&#160;<br>I was determined to do Mr. Smarty-Pants Whitacre one better, though. I had no intention of recycling somebody else&rsquo;s creation; I wanted a monster of my own.&#160; Tucked away in our bunk beds, my brother Steve and I whispered creepy-creature names at each other in the dark until we hit the jackpot: The Seaweed Strangler.&#160; We lived on Pymatuning Lake, which has more than its share of seaweed and swampy locations, and now that I had a main character and a setting, I was on my way.&#160; <br>&#160;<br>Okay, so <i>The Seaweed Strangler</i> didn&rsquo;t win any awards, and I didn&rsquo;t go on to become the next Steven Spielberg (who also started out with an 8-mm camera, by the way).&#160; The truth is that the movie is still a work in progress.&#160; I continue to blame the film editing machine that broke down in mid-edit thirty-plus years ago, but now that I&rsquo;ve had the film transferred to DVD, I&rsquo;m running out of excuses not to finish it.&#160;&#160; (All of which really irritates Steve, who still hasn&rsquo;t forgiven me for the two weeks he spent walking barefoot through the muck and mire while draped in seaweed!) <br>&#160;&#160; <br>Last summer, though, I found a way to revive the Seaweed Strangler -- to bring the creature, and my movie, back to life.&#160; I started work on a novel about a boy who discovers his father&rsquo;s partially finished movie -- titled, you guessed it, <i>The Seaweed Strangler</i> - and decides to add a few scenes of his own.&#160; No, I don&rsquo;t have a son in real life, but that&rsquo;s the best part about being a writer: I get to make stuff up, and use my imagination to let my characters do all the things I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>, or <i>hope</i> to, or don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to, or would <i>never</i>, do."

377,False,Jennifer Lynn,Jennifer Lynn Barnes,https://images.randomhouse.com/author/69151,Barnes,False,"I&#8217;ve wanted to be a writer for pretty much as long as I can remember. In fact, aside from a brief flirtation with the idea of being a veterinarian when I was four, being a professional writer has been my ultimate dream job (and, for that matter, my ultimate dream) for more or less my entire life. Along with my dislike of chocolate (I know, I&#8217;m a freak) and my love of all things sparkly, my passion for fiction&#8211;books, television, movies, and more&#8211;has probably been one of my most enduring character traits, and one of the ones that has most defined me as a person.<br><br>The summer I was 19, I wrote <i>Golden</i>, the story of a girl named Lissy who moves cross-country and lands right smack dab in the middle of the world&#8217;s scariest and most intimidating high school social hierarchy. Like Lissy, I changed schools at the start of my high school career. Unlike Lissy, however, I had to find my place at my new school without the aid of any kind of supernatural power.<br><br>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with the supernatural. When I was little, I used to watch <i>Bewitched</i> on television and wonder why it didn&#8217;t work when I twitched my own nose. In the third grade, I read Roald Dahl&#8217;s <i>Matilda</i> and spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to move things with the power of my mind. I love mythology, fairy tales, ghost stories, and the idea that there might be more out there than any of us can logically explain.<br><br>When I sit down to write a book, I usually start out with a supernatural concept&#8211;like aura vision or the idea of mystical tattoos capable of giving their wearers super powers&#8211;and then I think about my own experiences in life and try to identify an aspect of teen experience that fits with that particular slice of the supernatural. In <i>Golden</i>, Lissy&#8217;s ability to see auras gives her insight into the behavior of others, so I chose to throw her into the world of high school cliques, where her power would be both a blessing and a curse. <br><br>All of my characters lead double lives as normal teens in the every day teen world that have to deal with some pretty fantastical things. In many ways, I relate. Not because I have powers of my own (sadly, if I do have any super powers, they are as yet unidentified), but because throughout college, I lived my own double life&#8211;as a novelist and a student. I loved Yale, and didn&#8217;t want to miss out on any of my four years there, so more often than not, I was a college student by day and a writer by night, doing most of my writing between two and four in the morning, after everyone else had gone to sleep.<br><br>I&#8217;m a big believer that a writer has to be, first and foremost, a person who is out there in the world, experiencing life, and that is exactly what I try to do."
