Mostly for fun, but also because I wanted to try my hand at writing a fairy tale. I do that a lot as a writer&mdash;challenge myself to try new things&mdash;and tackling a fairy tale was <i>definitely</i> a new thing. So how to begin?&#160;<br><br>I knew I wanted my story to have a classical feel, incorporating such wonderfully delicious fairy-tale elements as four-and-twenty blackbirds, enchanted forests, and hairy trolls. On the other hand, I wanted it to be totally original, a story like no other. I began writing, and within a few weeks had a tale. But let me tell you a curious truth about writers&mdash;they <i>are</i> the stories they write, the fictions they spin. And when I read back what I had written, I realized I had created a fairy tale about . . . <i>me</i>. Weird, but true! The story is filled with my favorite things&mdash;journeys and birthdays and cake. The princess, taking after my son Scott, is allergic to strawberries. And Jack? Just like me, he good-naturedly follows life&rsquo;s road, gathering experiences he can spin into tales.<br><br>Spinning experiences into tales is what I did with <i>The Fabled Fifth Graders of Aesop Elementary School</i>, too. I visit lots of school, and there&rsquo;s nothing I like better than talking with kids, watching them in the lunchroom or on the playground, reading their essays and stories, listening to them tell jokes. And all the while I&rsquo;m doing these things, I&rsquo;m thinking about how I can use them in a book. Let me give you an example. A few years ago, I was visiting a school in Tennessee when a fifth-grade boy came up to me and said, &ldquo;Look what I can do.&rdquo; He stuck out his tongue, crossed his eyes and wiggled his ears &ndash; first the left one, and then the right one. I was impressed&mdash;but I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything yet! Within seconds, the rest of the fifth graders surround me. Everyone, it seemed, had some special body trick to show me&mdash;double-jointed fingers and toes, eyelids that folded, lips that could be pulled up over noses, knuckles that cracked to the tune of &ldquo;Yankee Doodle.&rdquo; It was absurd and wonderful, and I knew I had to write about it. The result? Chapter five titled, &ldquo;Hyper . . . Um . . . Hypermob . . . Um . . . Weird Body Tricks.&rdquo;</p>"

It was her idea that led to our first book together: <i>Today I Will</i>. She remembered reading daily devotionals, and it occurred to her that young readers might like a day-by-day book based on literature.<br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;There's a page in <i>Today I Will</i> for every day in the year&mdash;that&rsquo;s 366 pages/days, including leap year. Each page starts with a quote from children's or young adult literature. Then comes a commentary on the quote, followed by a resolution&mdash;that is, how you can apply the message to your day. The idea is that you take a minute to read the day's page when you get up in the morning. It helps to give your day a little direction.<br>&#160;&#160;<br><i>&#160;Today I Will </i>is just the latest in a long parade of ideas that Eileen has blessed me with. The sequel to <i>Stargirl</i>&mdash;<i>Love, Stargirl</i>&mdash;is one. The <i>Stargirl Journal </i>is another. &#160;<br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;Speaking of <i>Stargirl,</i> I guess you could say she gave me the idea for that one too, even though she never realized it. Listening to her talk about her childhood over the years, and getting to know this special person I happen to be married to, I found myself using Eileen again and again as my model as I developed the character of Susan Caraway, who names herself Stargirl. Two examples: Stargirl keeps notes on other people, so she knows when their birthdays are, what they like to eat, etc; and Stargirl has a &ldquo;happy wagon.&rdquo; I lifted both of these features from Eileen&rsquo;s personal history.<br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;She does more than supply me with ideas. She&rsquo;s my first reader and editor. When I finish a chapter, I put it on her desk. (We each have an office in our house.) She tells me if it&rsquo;s good (I go, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;) or not (I re-write). I do the same for her. It works so well for us, I sometimes wonder how any author can manage without a writing spouse. <br>&#160;&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;Sometimes we get asked: &ldquo;Do you compete with each other?&rdquo; The question always surprises us. The fact is, we are each other&rsquo;s biggest cheerleader. If Eileen writes a bestseller, I&rsquo;m probably happier about it than she is. There are no losers in our house.<br>&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;People who know we have seventeen grandchildren (at last count) often want to know if we get ideas from them. The answer is: Yes, we do. But there are many more sources to get stories from. We get story ideas from each other and from reading the newspaper and from memories of our own kidhoods and just from ordinary everyday life. &#160;<br>&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;With all this writing stuff going on in our House of Two Authors, you might wonder that it took us this long to write a book together. Actually, we did try it once before, years ago. It was a story about ideas in the form of cute, furry little creatures running around the house. That story was one idea we could have done without.

Despite the red buses and red post boxes, Ireland was bred in the bone. We were brought up as Irish-Catholic, went to Catholic schools with other Irish-Catholics, and spent our magical childhood summers playing with our Irish cousins in Ireland&#8217;s County Waterford. While there, we lived in a remote cottage with no water or electricity. We washed in water collected in rain barrels and read by gaslight.<br><br>The four of us used to liken ourselves to the girls in <i>Little Women</i>, which meant I was the spoilt one, Amy&#8211;the short straw. <br><br>From the age of seven, I scribbled down poems, ghost stories, and mystery stories and completed my first novel at the age of nine. It was about Anne, the daughter of a harried innkeeper in Bethlehem, and very, very <i>holey</i> (yes, that is how I spelt the word). But it fixed my aim to write for a living when I grew up.<br><br>By a long and circuitous route, I&#8217;ve finally attained this goal. In between going to Oxford University and studying Classics, working to promote human rights for the writers&#8217; association PEN, doing a Master&#8217;s degree in the social sciences, and living on both sides of the Atlantic (I worked for PEN American Centre in New York City between 1990 and 1997), I was always writing <i>something</i>. I wrote diaries, letters, entertainments for my nieces&#8217; and nephews&#8217; birthdays, as well as hundreds of nonfiction articles and reviews for newspapers and magazines. In a secret drawer, I kept a gargantuan adult manuscript-in-progress: I rewrote it four times before putting it aside.<br><br>Then I submitted a short story about a young Irish Traveller boy for <i>Skin Deep</i>, an anthology about racism aimed at young adults (Puffin, 2003). What joy when it was accepted! Encouraged, I wrote <i>A Swift Pure Cry</i> in three intensive months in the autumn of 2004. <br><br>The story was inspired by two shocking events that occurred in Ireland in 1984. The first was the tragic death of Anne Lovett, aged 15. Unable to seek help when she fell pregnant, she died of exposure and haemorrhaging while trying to give birth on her own in a grotto to the Virgin Mary in the village of Granard, County Longford. Her child also died. Members of her community pleaded in their own defence that they had been unaware of her predicament. <b><br><br></b>The second case was that of &#8216;the Kerry Babies.&#8217; A baby boy was found with multiple stab wounds, abandoned on a beach out on County Kerry&#8217;s Dingle Peninsula. The Gardai accused Joanne Hayes, a woman in her 20s who was known to have been pregnant out of wedlock, of having murdered him. She said she had buried her own baby boy, who had died, in a local field. I won&#8217;t describe here the bizarre train of events that unfolded, but the result was an independent tribunal and a nationwide furore. To date, the murderer of the stabbed baby boy and his parentage remain a mystery. <br><br>Perhaps it was a haunting sense of something unresolved in these tragedies that impelled me to write <i>A Swift Pure Cry</i>. Certainly, the story seemed to write itself. Shell Talent and her (completely fictional) story of loss and discovery must have been germinating in the back of my brain for 20 years. <br><br>Today, every day I don&#8217;t write feels like a lost day. I never believe that a story will be finished until I&#8217;ve typed the last period. And it is always a miracle if I get it down before being run over by a juggernaut. <br><br>The calm beauty of Oxford, where I live, and a kind, witty husband prevent me from being so doom-laden that I can&#8217;t write at all. I&#8217;m currently halfway through my fourth novel . . . and I&#8217;m being very careful crossing the road."

Needless to say my mom was not very happy with us that day, and I don&rsquo;t recommend ever surprising a parent that way with a new pet . . . but the good news is, she ended up loving Skippy as much as the rest of us did. <br> &#160;<br> Skippy and I had a very special relationship. At times it felt like we were actually talking to each other, especially when he would jump up into my lap, tilt his head and point just one ear up. It was as if he was just waiting for me to suggest something we could play together. One of our favorite things to do was to play hide-and-seek. There was an old oak tree that was perfect for climbing in the back yard. Well, no matter how often Skippy and I played hide-and-seek, I would always use the tree as one of my hiding places. I remember climbing up as high as I could go, while Skippy was wandering around in the front yard. After positioning myself comfortably in the highest branches, I would call, &ldquo;SKIPPY. . . COME AND FIND ME!&rdquo; Then I would hear the jingle of his dog tags, and wait and watch for him to come around to the back yard. I had a good view, peeking through the green clumps of leaves. As he got closer, I would call again and he would come running to the tree, never looking up, just circling the base, looking confused. Then he would run and sniff and snoop under bushes, behind the shed, or on the swing set. Finally, after a few more calls and more searching, I would quietly sneak down to the lowest branch and then jump to the ground, yelling, &ldquo;HEEEERRRRE I AMMMM!&rdquo; He would come running, so excited to see me, seeming so surprised that I had been hiding in the big oak. The funny thing is, no matter how many times I hid in that old oak tree, he never looked up to see me there. He never remembered that I always hid in the tree . . . or did he?<br> &#160;<br> Today I wonder if Skippy always knew. Perhaps he was just letting me stay there while he pretended to hunt for me in other places? Skippy knew how to be a good sport and how to play with vigor. He taught me how to find enjoyment in the little things. <br> &#160;<br> I hope you enjoy meeting the characters in <i>The Carnival of the Animals</i>. Perhaps you too will make a special connection."

I grew up in a word-loving environment. My father is the king of puns, spoonerisms, and wordplay. The idea of a character named Precious Darling was intriguing. Would she be precious? Or darling? Of course not. Life rarely works out that way. Precious Darling and her equally ironically named sisters stuck with me and begged me to write about them. (Of course they did. They&#8217;re that vain!) Other characters I write about have more realistic roots. Libby, the main character in the story, is a cross between several strong young people I&#8217;ve known over the years. Frannie, Libby&#8217;s little sister, is very much like a precocious and always-entertaining young lady who is growing up my house. <br><br>I&#8217;ve spent the second half my life-so-far on a farm. I grew up with farming relatives, but my family and I lived in the suburbs. I spent a lot of summer days visiting my cousin&#8217;s dairy farm, searching the haymow for new kittens and learning to walk barefooted in manure. I didn&#8217;t always love the farm animals. I used to have nightmares about huge Holstein cows walking up my driveway. When I went to college and met the farmer of my dreams, I knew I&#8217;d have to face my animal fears head on. Those big, old steers can still make me take a step backwards (away from their back end), but I&#8217;ve grown to respect them. <br><br>I&#8217;m always so impressed when I watch young people with their livestock at a county fair. The level of maturity, the amount of time and energy, and the physical nature of the work they do are amazing. (Not to mention, it&#8217;s just a dirty and sometimes stinky job to clean up after farm animals.) But there is nothing quite like auction night. The lights, the auctioneer&#8217;s booming song, the ringman&#8217;s yelping call to signal a bid, the pacing animals in the ring, and most of all, the youngsters at the other end of the lead rope. The emotions on their faces are as mixed as the feelings in their hearts. Pride. They&#8217;ve raised an outstanding, functional animal. Excitement. It&#8217;s the night they&#8217;ve worked for all year. Heartbreak. In minutes, it&#8217;ll be over. It will be time to say goodbye. <br><br>When I wrote about this in <i>The Beef Princess of Practical County</i>, my editor asked me what I suppose anyone who hasn&#8217;t experienced farm life would ask. Why? Why do the kids do it again and again if it&#8217;s such a painful life experience? That was my challenge in completing the book. How will Libby face the auction ring? Will she even face it at all? Writing is about living, and living is about growing and making decisions that ring true to your own beliefs. Libby may have faced some of the toughest decisions she ever had to make, but she always remained true to herself. Even in the presence of the dreaded, ditzy Darling sisters. And that&#8217;s no bull!"

I really thought that if I looked hard enough, I might find a magic nickel or a secret room behind the bookcase or a gnarled gnome whom only I could see. As I grew older, I felt the same thrill of seeing mysteries unveiled when I went to the theatre or read a book. In my childhood activities, I played with dolls way past the normal age, made dioramas out of junk scraps, directed backyard plays with casts of neighborhood kids, and was always, always reading&ndash;only as an adult can I clearly see my pursuit of illusion.<br>When I was 14, I spent a year in a Quaker boarding school in England, encountering a world utterly different from my own, no magic necessary. I learned the advantage of being a stranger; I created a new character for myself, far from my family and not dependent on anyone&rsquo;s preconceptions. This later fed my approach to fiction: My heroines are small part &ldquo;me&rdquo; and large part invention of who I&rsquo;d like to be, or to have been. <br>My earliest chapter books (the Invisible trilogy) were about an ordinary child who stumbles across enchantment. My next several books were historical novels (<i>Earthly Astonishments, Mable Riley, </i>and<i> How It Happened in Peach Hill</i>), set in worlds utterly different from my own. It&rsquo;s easy to see in retrospect that exploring alternate realities began as a game in childhood and eventually became a consuming pastime, otherwise known as research. I <i>love</i> doing research. I depend on what I learn not only for flavor and accuracy of details, but also for the occasional serendipitous discovery that alters the plot of a story.<br>But then we come to my most recent novel, <i>Would You</i>. It is a complete departure from any of my other stories, because its inception was in the accident that gravely injured my sister when I was 20 years old and she was 27. Paula was hit by a car and remained comatose for several weeks. When she emerged, she was severely brain-damaged and a paraplegic. Ten years later, she was again hit by a car&ndash;in her wheelchair&ndash;and killed. <br>Friends were concerned that <i>Would You</i> would be too difficult to write. In fact, it was the easiest book I&rsquo;ve tackled yet. I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about plot! The characters are teenagers and the main challenge was to capture their irreverence and humor alongside the tragedy.<br>The friendship between the sisters, Natalie and Claire, is inspired by that of my own two daughters. As a mother, I delight in the love they have for each other. It is impossible not to think about my own sister and what I have lost. But here I am, 30 years later, having a fine life, and surrounded with the alternate reality that only teenagers can provide. I hope that I have written an elegy for my sister and an homage to my children."

I am, and always have been, from the &ldquo;Only Boring People Are Bored&rdquo; school of thought, and worked hard as a child to develop and use my imagination. One of my favorite experiences from that time of my life is when I decided I had a future in Hollywood. <br>&#160;<br>It practically kills me to admit this, but I got the idea from a made-for-TV movie on &ldquo;The Wonderful World of Disney,&rdquo; a Sunday evening staple in our home in Andover, Ohio.&#160; Johnny Whitacre, who was my age, starred in <i>The Mystery of Dracula&rsquo;s Castle, </i>in which his character makes a movie. I was nothing if not stubborn, and figured that if Johnny Whitacre could do it, so could I.&#160; And so, at thirteen, armed with my dad&rsquo;s 8-millimeter movie camera, some plastic fangs, and a few tubes of fake blood, I set out to make a horror movie.&#160; <br>&#160;<br>I was determined to do Mr. Smarty-Pants Whitacre one better, though. I had no intention of recycling somebody else&rsquo;s creation; I wanted a monster of my own.&#160; Tucked away in our bunk beds, my brother Steve and I whispered creepy-creature names at each other in the dark until we hit the jackpot: The Seaweed Strangler.&#160; We lived on Pymatuning Lake, which has more than its share of seaweed and swampy locations, and now that I had a main character and a setting, I was on my way.&#160; <br>&#160;<br>Okay, so <i>The Seaweed Strangler</i> didn&rsquo;t win any awards, and I didn&rsquo;t go on to become the next Steven Spielberg (who also started out with an 8-mm camera, by the way).&#160; The truth is that the movie is still a work in progress.&#160; I continue to blame the film editing machine that broke down in mid-edit thirty-plus years ago, but now that I&rsquo;ve had the film transferred to DVD, I&rsquo;m running out of excuses not to finish it.&#160;&#160; (All of which really irritates Steve, who still hasn&rsquo;t forgiven me for the two weeks he spent walking barefoot through the muck and mire while draped in seaweed!) <br>&#160;&#160; <br>Last summer, though, I found a way to revive the Seaweed Strangler -- to bring the creature, and my movie, back to life.&#160; I started work on a novel about a boy who discovers his father&rsquo;s partially finished movie -- titled, you guessed it, <i>The Seaweed Strangler</i> - and decides to add a few scenes of his own.&#160; No, I don&rsquo;t have a son in real life, but that&rsquo;s the best part about being a writer: I get to make stuff up, and use my imagination to let my characters do all the things I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>, or <i>hope</i> to, or don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to, or would <i>never</i>, do."

Crutcher claims his parents &#8220;were in Cascade before I got dry,&#8221; referring to Cascade, Idaho, the small lumber and logging town of about 950 people where he was raised.<br><br>As a youth, ALAN Award&#8211;winning and six-time ALA award-winning author Chris Crutcher was not an outstanding student. He attributes his academic non-achievements to having an older brother who was &#8220;real bright. He was the valedictorian of the class, and I don&#8217;t think he got anything under an A minus the whole time he was in high school. I got a good picture of what that was like and decided I didn&#8217;t want anything to do with it.&#8221;<br><br>Not many people, least of all anyone connected with his education, would have imagined that Crutcher would ever become a writer. Though both of his parents were voracious readers, reading was not one of Chris&#8217;s favorite pastimes. In fact, he read a grand total of one book from cover to cover during his entire four years of high school. When it came to writing book reports, he invented titles for reports, as well as stories to go with them, and often got his authors from the pages of the Boise telephone directory. He also copied from his brother. Many times, Chris would &#8220;take one of his [brother&#8217;s] book reports and misspell a few words, take it &#8216;down&#8217; a few notches, and turn it in.&#8221;<br><br>After high school, Crutcher attended Eastern Washington State College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology/sociology. Chris admits he naively thought he could just turn up at the college of his choice on opening day and register. Upon learning in senior year that applications were necessary, &#8220;I ran down to the library. All the college catalogs were either black or blue, and Eastern&#8217;s was red, so I took it.&#8221;<br><br>After graduation, he roamed around the country with a friend for a year. Then he went back to school for a teaching certificate. He spent nearly 10 years in Oakland, California, as Director of a K&#8211;12 alternative school for inner-city kids. In 1980, Crutcher moved back to Washington and settled in Spokane, where he works as a child and family therapist in a mental health center, focusing on child-abuse cases.<br><br>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t start writing until I was 35. It&#8217;s hard to imagine my life not writing. I love it. There&#8217;s really a part of it that&#8217;s connection. When you&#8217;re watching somebody read your material and they smile and nod, you know you&#8217;ve found that place where your experience and their experience match, even though they aren&#8217;t the same exact experience. Any time I write something and you say, &#8216;Yah,&#8217; boy, it&#8217;s a kick!&#8221;<br><br>Chris Crutcher&#8217;s novels are a reflection of real life as he sees it. As in real life, his novels combine humor with difficult and serious situations. He draws heavily on his own experiences and on elements that have surrounded his life. For example, the tiny lumber town of Cascade, Idaho, where Crutcher grew up became the fictional village of Trout, Idaho, in his novel <i>Running Loose</i>. His experiences working for the alternative school in Oakland formed the basis of <i>The Crazy Horse Electric Game</i>. And the emphasis on swimming in <i>Stotan!</i> comes directly from Crutcher&#8217;s own involvement in this sport in college.<br><br>His book <i>Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes</i> was praised by <i>School Library Journal</i> in a starred review as &#8220;a masterpiece.&#8221; In this darkly funny, suspenseful novel about friendship, a high-school senior tries to help his badly scarred best friend, Sarah Byrnes, deal with a horrific event in her past.<br><br><br><b>PRAISE<br><br></b>ATHLETIC SHORTS <br>&#8220;A winning collection of stories. . . .

In <i>Before I Die,</i> the protagonist is dying, but the novel is actually an examination of what it means to be alive. In <i>You Against Me</i>, there has been an allegation of sexual assault, but at the book&rsquo;s heart is a love story. <br>&#160;<br><b>What inspired you to write <i>You Against Me</i>?</b><br>I actually knew very little when I started writing. I had a few ideas, but they were abstract, theoretical, as if I knew the tone of the piece, but nothing else. I always use free writing techniques when I start a new book, which is a bit like improvising in theatre&mdash;throwing words down and not planning anything in advance. Most of it goes in the bin, but the strongest themes and voices keep returning. <br>&#160;<br>After months of this, I began to know more. I was haunted by a small seaside town, by a girl called Karyn who alleged something terrible had happened to her and by her brother, Mikey, who was out for revenge.<br>&#160;<br><b>Your new novel handles a very tough topic that effects many teens. What was that responsibility like and how did it inform your writing?</b><br>I often felt overwhelmed with responsibility. I didn&rsquo;t want any girl or young woman to pick&#160;up my book and think after reading it that they shouldn&rsquo;t&#160;bother reporting an assault, and yet I wanted the novel to accurately reflect the very difficult realities of&#160;prosecuting a case such as this.<br>&#160;<br>I tried not to let my fear inform the writing. The danger was that I would hold back on tackling anything too difficult in case I offended anyone. To counter the fear, I interviewed criminal lawyers, social workers, family support workers and police officers. I watched court cases and read lots of books. The research really grounded the novel, but it slowed me down a lot too. When the first draft was finished, every single one of the people who helped me with research read it and gave feedback. I wanted any gender bias or prejudice to come from the characters, not from the author. I wanted to be sure I wasn&rsquo;t perpetuating any myths or stereotypes around sexual assault.<br>&#160;<br><b>Were there any other young adult works that you found particularly helpful or inspirational while working on <i>You Against Me</i>?</b><br>I tend to steer away from fiction that is thematically similar when I am writing. I stick to nonfiction books about the subject instead. <br><br><b>The two main characters of <i>You Against Me</i> are not directly involved in the incident that the book centers around. Did you know from the beginning that you would tell the story from the perspectives of Mikey and Ellie, the siblings of the victim and the accused?</b><br>I originally started writing from Karyn&rsquo;s point of view, but it became clear quite quickly that her perspective was too &ldquo;hot.&rdquo; In fact, she was a very unreliable narrator, often unwilling and mostly silent, almost as if she didn&rsquo;t want to be in the story. At that point, her brother Mikey took over the narrative. In fact he ran with it. He was determined to avenge his sister and all I had to do was follow him.<br>&#160;<br>I loved writing Mikey because he was a mass of contradictions&mdash;he&rsquo;d left school with limited prospects, yet was hugely ambitious. The main carer for his family, he also managed to juggle a complicated love life. Bright, but often inarticulate, he had an innate distrust of authority, yet his family were dependent on police and social workers for support.<br>&#160;<br>I thought I&rsquo;d found the book&rsquo;s narrative voice, but then Ellie appeared&mdash;clever, determined Ellie. She&rsquo;d recently moved to the area and had no friends yet. She did, however, have a brother and she certainly seemed to know a lot more than she was saying about what had happened to Mikey&rsquo;s sister. <br>&#160;<br>With two voices, a more complex narrative began to emerge. I also knew that being one step back from what happened was a more interesting way to tackle the subject of assault and all the prejudice that surrounds it. <br>&#160;<br><b>While dealing with sexual assault, <i>You Against Me</i> is much more than an &ldquo;issues&rdquo; book. Was the theme of finding love in unexpected places something that evolved during the course of your writing?</b><br><i>You Against Me</i> is a love story, but the love is fought for under very difficult circumstances. It&rsquo;s also about truth, about looking at someone you know really well and wondering if you know them at all. Those two threads evolved quite quickly as I wrote. &#160;I don&rsquo;t want my job as a writer to be about looking at &ldquo;issues&rdquo; or giving moral guidance. Teens don&rsquo;t want to read about things adults think are good for them, or about how they <i>ought</i> to behave. <br>&#160;<br>Of course, books can address difficult situations and confront social issues and help readers deal with real-life challenges. They can transport you, make you think, move you . . . the list is endless. Ultimately though, it&rsquo;s the story&mdash;with all its complexities, with the emotional truths it uncovers, the experiences beyond the everyday that it gives, that will be the real reason why young people read.<br>&#160;<br><b>The Parkers and the McKenzies are from different social classes. What inspired you to have these families, and Mikey and Ellie, come from such varied worlds?</b><br>I know it sounds odd, but I have no clue about character, geography, social class, or anything else when I begin a novel. After months of generating material, I begin to get a clearer idea of what a book might be about. I guess I had Romeo and Juliet in the back of my mind because I was interested in loving someone forbidden. But I also had Hamlet in my mind&mdash;something rotten in your own family.<br>&#160;<br>It was important to me that my two central protagonists would never have met under normal circumstances. I wanted them to have to tackle their own prejudices about each others&rsquo; backgrounds, as well as their preconceptions about the assault. I wanted them to fall in love &ldquo;despite themselves.&rdquo;<br><i>&#160;</i><br><b>What do you hope that readers come away with after reading <i>You Against Me</i>?</b><br>I was attempting to write a good story, one that moved readers emotionally, but also made them think. I hope that the book encourages debate for the very reason that I am <i>not </i>telling anyone what the right answers are."

This is what it says:<br>&#160;<br><b>Regularly Posed Inquiries (RPIs)</b><br>&#160;<br><b>1. Where are you from?</b><br>I grew up in the middle of the woods near Cunot, Indiana. I had dogs, ducks, chickens, sisters and a baby brother. (Hi, Nate!) We played in the woods all the time, which is pretty great when you think about it.<br>&#160;<br><b>2. Were you a nerdy kid?</b><br>No way.&#160; Everyone in school gave me the respect that a level 12 Paladin (with +4 &#160;Boots of Dexterity) deserves.<br>&#160;<br><b>3. How did you wind up becoming a writer-slash-illustrator?</b><br>In grade school, I spent most of my leisure time drawing comics. Around fifth grade or so, I created my masterpiece: a comic called &ldquo;Star Quack.&rdquo;&#160; It was an epic story about a duck and robot who tried to explore the universe but always wound up getting attacked by intergalactic space monsters. (Write what you know.)<br>&#160;<br>I went on to draw cartoons for my high school and college newspapers. (I recommend becoming a staff artist for a school paper &ndash; they have lots of space to fill and will accept anything you submit. Even if it&rsquo;s a weekly comic strip titled &ldquo;Death By Bear Attack.&rdquo;)<br>&#160;<br>Then, like a lot of people in their early 20s, I started to experiment with graphic design. At first it was just once or twice a month &ndash; a logo here, a T-shirt there.&#160; But pretty soon I was designing newspaper pages, laying out posters, and editing photos almost every day.&#160; I even learned what &ldquo;kerning&rdquo; was.<br>&#160;<br>This led to internships and jobs at a bunch of newspapers and Web sites, which in turn led to my becoming a full-time illustrator.&#160; Slash-writer.<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br><b>4. Do you think that really what it all boils down to is that you just have to keep at it?&#160; In other words, once you stop writing, then it&rsquo;s really hard to start again? And that the same goes for drawing?&#160; Or even playing the saxophone? &#160;Oh, and also that the more you create, the easier it is to create the next thing, be it writing a story or drawing a picture or sculpting a national park out of mashed potatoes or anything, really?</b><br><b>&#160;</b><br>Yes.<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br><b>5. Finally, do you have four helpful tips for people who want to become writers-slash-illustrators?</b><br>&#160;<br>Of course! Here you go.<br>&#160;<br>1) Take all your notes on legal paper.&#160; The size of the paper doesn&rsquo;t matter, just as long as you&rsquo;ve obtained it without breaking the law.<br>&#160;<br>2) Do all your sketches with a fancy pen. This will impress everyone in the coffee shop, even if your artwork is just so-so. I prefer the Finial-Weatherford broad point fountain pen, with a no. 3 ox-tooth nib, enamel-plated quills, and two eyes made out of coal.<br>&#160;<br>3) Make sure your computer is up to date.&#160; (Rule of thumb: a good writing computer should weigh at least seven pounds.&#160; Twice that if you&rsquo;re planning to write a teenage vampire romance.)<br>&#160;<br>4) Stuck on the ending? Try adverbs! Adverbs are a great way to end any story. Seriously."

But there is more to it than that. In writing, I've found that a change of direction has a psychic trigger. Sometimes you go looking for the trigger and sometimes it just happens. <br><br> I was casting back recently, trying to find out what&#8211;apart from the obvious reason of having my own children&#8211;had set me on this course. And I realized that it originated in an incident&#8211;a ghostly incident if you like from about five years ago. <br><br> There's a village called Cong in County Mayo. It's well known as the setting for the John Huston film <i>The Quiet Man.</i> But apart from that, it is a beautiful place beside Lough Corrib, full of woods and old abbeys, underground rivers and lake islands. We went there on holidays as children and spent the summer cycling, fishing, swimming, and exploring from early in the morning until late at night. I loved it.<br><br> I remember my first visit. I was exploring the ruins of the abbey on my own when a gang of children appeared from nowhere. They had a football and invited me to join their game. We played into the dusk in the shade of ancient yew trees, bats wheeling overhead. Then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, they ran off laughing into the dark. <br><br> When I got back, the locals were puzzled. The children weren't from the village and there was nobody staying nearby that they knew of. <br><br> I tried going back to Cong as an adult, but it was a melancholy thing. There were too many memories, too many laughing faces now gone, too many ghosts. It was beautiful but sad. <br><br> I decided to give it one more try, this time with my wife and young daughter. I took Kathleen for a walk at the abbey before bed. The light was fading. Kathleen ran across the grass towards the yews and then, as before, a gang of children materialized from nowhere with a football. They beckoned to her and she joined in their game. They played on into the lengthening shadows while I watched from the steps of the abbey. To me, they seemed not just metaphorically but, in reality, to be the same children I had played with all those years ago; their laughing voices ringing out as they had before. And as I stood there I realized that the melancholy I had felt came not from the ghosts of others who were no longer there, but from the ghost that was myself as a child, a ghost who haunted these ancient stones. <br><br> As they had done before the children ran off into the darkness. Kathleen came back to me. It seems fanciful to think that they could have been my playmates from the past. All the same something happened in the dusk at Cong abbey. Something that put the man I had become back in touch with the boy that I had been. I knew who he was solitary and watchful. A boy who held himself just a little apart in company. A pale, wary face in the abbey shadows. <br><br> He was a reader and alert to other worlds in a way that is not available to an adult, and once I knew him again I could write for him. I don't know about other writers, but I am usually my own ideal reader, and now I&#160;knew that reader-man and boy."

Everybody says just what they mean, with few embellishments, regardless of who likes it, or whether it makes sense.<br><br>&#8220;How do you suppose that we ever ended up with a writer in this family?&#8221; my mother asks.<br><br>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; I reply. &#8220;Anyway, I may be something else next year.&#8221; But it makes me wonder what exactly my family has had to do with my being a writer. Here are some things I remember about growing up among them.<br><br>My father and brother are engineers&#8212;they can tell you how anything works. When my brother won the Jermyn (Pennsylvania) Soap Box Derby race on the hill outside our house on Franklin Street, I was sure our family had reached its pinnacle of fame.<br><br>My mother, who acts and speaks without pretense or subtlety, is matter-of-factly brave and has an intuitive mind. You didn&#8217;t dare contemplate doing anything you weren&#8217;t supposed to do when she was around. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you even think about it,&#8221; she&#8217;d say. When I was twelve, Charlie Fron, our school bus driver, told me she was a good mother, and that she could make a whole busload of kids behave by just looking at them. I stood there a moment, breathing in the silage smell of the bus (Charlie kept it in his barn when the weather was cold) and thought my heart would burst with pride.<br><br>My father&#8217;s mother, Mema Fisher, was gentle and lovely&#8212;she knew about color and texture and mood. Her eye was always cocked for a shapely flower, even if it was a weed; her ear was always tuned to the sounds of the woods. She had a chaotic garden that was always in bloom, and I loved going to her sitting room to listen to our favorite songs (which included &#8220;Mockingbird Hill&#8221;) on her record player.<br><br>Mema Brittain, my other grandmother, and my aunt Elaine were compassionate women. They were capable of understanding and forgiving almost everything. Unlike the rest of my tall, large-boned family, they were delicate and feminine. I was a flower girl at Aunt Elaine&#8217;s wedding, and I treasured the weeks of preparation, during which the two of them introduced me to the mysteries of face creams and perfume and silk slips.<br><br>I found out much later why it was that my mother had absolutely nothing (except love) in common with the two of them&#8212;but that&#8217;s another story.<br><br>When I was small, I would float in the bathtub made especially for my very long father and create scenes in my head in which I would be a diva or a famous actress.<br><br>I lived to fish. In the summer, I got up before dawn and climbed into my bathing suit, shorts, and T-shirt. I&#8217;d spend every day on the dock in front of our summerhouse on Chapman Lake with a line in the water, daydreaming about all the exotic places I&#8217;d ever heard of, stopping only when it got hot to jump into the icy water. At night we&#8217;d go out with flashlights to pounce on nightcrawlers for the next day&#8217;s fishing. My sister Karen thought my activities were unspeakable. She and her friends met to paint their nails. (<i>Another </i>story, perhaps.)<br><br>I was a liberal arts major in college, mainly because I couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation to read to my heart&#8217;s content and get credit for it. After graduation I had various jobs, all having something to do with writing and research. Eventually I landed in Hong Kong, where I became a reporter for United Press International. For six years I alternated between being a desk rat and covering the China story, meeting scholars, artists, lawyers, and businessmen who had been inside China, which until 1978 had been closed to Americans for a quarter of a century. I played tennis overlooking the harbor, sailed on the South China Sea, ate Suchow food in the back alleys of the Western District, and sometimes talked until dawn in hotel bars with triad gang members, Chinese Communists, and other questionable characters who would have made my mother&#8217;s hair stand on end. (Yet another story!)<br><br>When UPI offered me my own bureau in South Asia, my mother said, &#8220;Come home. Quit this Mata Hari life and meet a nice man, get married, and have some children.&#8221; But I had friends who were living sensible lives, and they hadn&#8217;t necessarily ended up with love, marriage, and houses full of happy children. So I went to India.<br><br>It&#8217;s been said that revolutions happen in ten-year cycles. In 1989, it was the extraordinary events of Eastern Europe. In 1979, the year I went to India, the revolution in Iran resulted in the taking of American hostages. Here are some of the things that happened that year in the countries my UPI bureau covered: In Pakistan, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged. Islamic fundamentalists burned the American Embassy in Islamabad with ninety people inside. Most of them survived, but six people died. In India, Indira Gandhi presided over the demise of the government of Morarji Desai and returned to power, beginning a period of more violence than at any time since the aftermath of the independence of India and Pakistan from British rule in 1947. Civil war broke out in Afghanistan, two prime ministers were killed in office, and Soviet troops entered the country, to remain for ten bloody years.<br><br>Keeping up with these events resulted in the most adventurous phase of my life to date. I traveled extensively with Mrs. Gandhi as she campaigned. We talked early in the morning over tea and late at night over warm milk. I shot the first photographs of Soviet troops being airlifted into Kabul. In the ranks of soldiers marching across the tarmac at the Kabul airport, one carried a Christmas tree on his shoulders. Fear was as thick as dust in the air. Our Afghan colleagues and friends began to disappear.<br><br>Three years followed in Washington, during which I worked on a part-time basis for <i>The Washington Post</i> and began to write fiction. I returned to Pakistan in 1985 to work under contract to the U.S. Agency for International Development on a study of poor rural women. It was during this time I met an extraordinary girl in the Cholistan Desert, the daughter of a nomadic camel herder, whose story became the basis for <i>Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind</i> and <i>Haveli</i>.<br><br>If there is anything special at all about us odd ducks who write, it is our passion for stories. I used to worry that I&#8217;d run out of stories, but so far I haven&#8217;t.

I do not have parakeets because I don&#8217;t like cages and in my mind having parakeets is one step away from wearing housecoats, lycra in public, and owning 50 cats, all named Sweetie. <br><br>It&#8217;s going to get harder . . . 1) I make wedding cakes for fun; 2) I love reality TV&#8211;especially dating shows; 3) I have four kids and am married; 4) I don&#8217;t miss a minute of March Madness basketball if I can help it.<br><br>Think you know? I do make wedding cakes for fun, and birthday cakes, and I love you cakes, and cakes of all kinds. I love to bake. If you want to see photos of cakes I&#8217;ve made just visit my Web site at AmberKizer.com. I do love reality TV&#8211;and especially dating shows, the raunchier it is, the funnier and the better it is. Please don&#8217;t hold this against me, I&#8217;m in therapy to break the addiction! I adore college hoops and try not to miss any of the tournaments&#8211;men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s. I&#8217;m not married and don&#8217;t have kids&#8211;I&#8217;m young and, while I do hope those things are in my future somewhere way down the line, they&#8217;re on the wish list rather than in the cart. I am, however, in stock and ready to ship. <br><br>All right, I&#8217;m done being nice to you. Here&#8217;s a hard one: 1) I read 15&#8212;20 books concurrently; 2) I quilt; 3) Roses are my favorite flower; 4) I collect amber jewelry when I travel.<br><br>I do read a huge, high stack of books all at the same time&#8211;it keeps it interesting. There&#8217;s too much to learn in the world to read one from start to finish. So I read a chapter, change books, read a chapter and so on, until whatever I&#8217;m reading is so compelling I have to finish the book. Pretty much any topic is game, but I stay away from math theory and computer programming because they just give me a headache. I do quilt&#8211;I love working with colors and fabrics. I don&#8217;t quilt as often as I&#8217;d like because these hands are usually wrung dry from typing, but yum, it feeds my creative soul to stitch fabrics together. Roses are a favorite, but my ultimate favorite flowers are lilies&#8211;Casablanca white ones, Stargazer pinks, any of the really fragrant lilies&#8211;the scent makes my soul smile. So that was kinda a trick one because, of course, I collect amber jewelry. I love it and it looks good with my coloring, so it&#8217;s a win win. <br><br>Now, to the super-duper difficult ones: 1) I&#8217;ve wanted to be a writer since I could talk; 2) I wrote my first book at the age of five called &#8220;Wiggle Me, Tiggle Me&#8221;; 3) I only write when my muse taps me on the shoulder; 4) I don&#8217;t have to do much editing; it&#8217;s usually close to perfect the first time around.<br><br>Think you know? Ha ha, changed it up&#8211;they&#8217;re all LIES! LIES, LIES, LIES! Okay, so maybe that wasn&#8217;t fair, but it was fun. I always wanted to be a criminal prosecuting attorney and eventually a Supreme Court Justice. (Can you spell <i>overachiever</i> anyone?) But I played basketball fervently, and over the course of high school, I ended up with some fairly nasty injuries to my feet and legs. Those led to surgeries, which then gave room to a rare nerve disorder. I developed symptoms at age 18 and it totally and completely sucks (just telling it like it is). In the simplest of terms, the system that controls pain signals, temperature, circulation, and all that very important stuff is corrupted to the point that it&#8217;s wrong all the time&#8211;which means my legs hurt all the time and don&#8217;t always work for me when I ask them to. So this means my life has to be fairly fluid&#8211;I can not tell you how many plans I&#8217;ve had to cancel, how many shows I&#8217;ve given away tickets to, how many great ideas I&#8217;ve had to say &#8220;sorry&#8221; to. I know someone loves me when I say I&#8217;m hurting and they show up with ice cream and a video when we were supposed to go out. This also means that I can&#8217;t count on my legs to have a structured 9 to 5 job (although I&#8217;d love to do any number of things on a consistent basis), so I had to figure out a career that was flexible and that I could do on the good days, or from a horizontal position on the bad ones. A friend invited me to a workshop she was giving on how to teach writing to kids. I did all the activities, and I was hooked on storytelling. I came away from that six weeks with six pages of a story. I wanted to know the ending, so I kept writing. <br><br>Oh, and I should probably tell you that I started in adult romances. Yes, that&#8217;s right, I <i>love</i> romances and they&#8217;re completely a hoot to write&#8211;a hopeless romantic, I adore happy endings and who doesn&#8217;t like hot, steamy, monkey s---socks. Monkey socks.  So I wrote one book, then another, then another. The whole time I was learning what I could about the craft&#8211;it&#8217;s like wanting to be a great artist you need to know the techniques and tools of the craft, and you have to practice. I also spent a great deal of time learning the business end of things&#8211;how agents work, how publishing works, what to expect, what to do right, and what to avoid doing at all costs. There&#8217;s so much to learn I&#8217;m convinced I will never know it all. But I worked my way up the scale from form letter rejections to handwritten notes to long, involved letters asking for revisions. <br><br>I was working on my fourth romance when a voice in my head started giving editorial input. &#8220;He put his hand where? That so wouldn&#8217;t happen . . . eeewww.&#8221; And on and on. Meet Gert. She had things to say and I desperately needed her to shut up, so I opened a new word document and went at it. I figured I&#8217;d let her go until she ran out of steam and then I could get back to the real writing. I guessed 20 pages tops before she ran out of things to say. That was 2005 and she&#8217;s still going. Nothing is off limits, she talks about everything&#8211;even the stuff parents hope their kids don&#8217;t know about. <i>One Butt Cheek</i> is the first in her series&#8211;the second <i>From Butt to Booty</i> comes out next fall.<br><br>I always edit. I always rewrite. And there are no such things as <i>muses</i> unless you use that as a synonym for <i>discipline</i> or <i>perseverance</i>. <br><br>My advice for anyone who thinks they want to be a writer is to hang glide. No, again that&#8217;s not the truth, but it sounds way more interesting than the truth, which is to . . . um . . . write. Also get good at surviving rejection because you have to. Because you have to put yourself out there all the time and learn how to shake it off and do it all over again the next day. You won&#8217;t get published if you don&#8217;t send it out. And you won&#8217;t get published if you send out crap that you haven&#8217;t perfected to the best of your ability. But it&#8217;s not easy, it&#8217;s not pain free and it&#8217;s not for the weak of spirit. It&#8217;s hard, competitive, and everyone thinks because they type out e-mails that writing a book can&#8217;t be much harder than that. Oh yeah, everyone thinks they could write the next bestseller without breaking a sweat, everyone thinks they&#8217;re a writer&#8211;just know that up front. <br><br>So here&#8217;s my advice&#8211;it&#8217;s really good practice to ask the cute boy out, call the girl who you&#8217;ve been crushing on since sixth grade, make yourself available and vulnerable. Because here&#8217;s the deal, they might say yes, they might have been enamored of you for ages, too. Because you could get the call that says, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a contract offer on your book!&#8221; Or at the very least you&#8217;ll have some soul-wrenching real-life experience to write about and that, my friends, is the truth and nothing but the truth. So help me Gert."

I think I must have thought that books were born on the library shelves. But I was good at writing stories, and I had a good deal of practice.<br><br>My primary school teacher came in every Monday morning in the worst of moods. 'Fetch my bag'. He'd lay his leather strap across the front of his desk as a threat or warning. Then he'd turn and chalk up three titles on the board: <i>A Day in the Life of a Lost Umbrella, My Best Friend, The Worst</i> <i>Advice I</i> <i>ever Took</i>; anything like that. Then: 'I want absolute silence till break-time' he'd say, nursing his hungover head. 'The first person to whisper gets the strap'.<br><br>I loved those double lessons more than anything in the world (except for reading). No endless discussions. No sharing of ideas. No realising that someone else had also had your brilliant idea. I covered reams of paper. I wrote fast. And I learned to judge the form and the length of a story. It was the best training I could ever have had, though I didn't know I'd be a writer.<br><br>I still work with a pencil and rubber in absolute silence. I still hide my work with my arms if anyone walks past, and I wouldn't dream of talking about what I'm writing or let a soul look at it until it's completely finished. Oh - and I still prefer reading other people's books to writing my own!<br><br>A lot of my work, even for fairly young readers, raises quite serious social issues. I believe that many personal decisions have a social or political resonance, and the way people try to pick their way through tricky family situations interests me. But people won't (and shouldn't) read books that don't hold their interest, and I still adore funny books. So since I write for the reader inside myself, I always end up with the kind of book I would have loved to read (if only someone else had bothered to write for me)."

Because she tells dangerous truths. &#8220;This is what it is like to be complete. It is horrible.&#8221; <br><br>Sylvia forges through the crests and the crashes of self-examination for us on her pages. Her writing binds me to her, close, under her skull and skin. And I think that may be one of the primary things great writing can do&#8211; become your companion.<br><br>And what an insightful companion she is! Tossing off lines like &#8220;The courage of a shut mouth, in spite of artillery!&#8221; When I read, &#8220;It was a place of force&#8212;the wind gagging my mouth with my own blown hair,&#8221; her expression of <i>my own experiences </i>seemed uncanny. I have lived in that boxed space of being in a relationship with someone by choice and yet feeling that I had no choice but to stay, as I had willingly put myself in that cage. And yet when I wrote about this, my own words did not express my feelings as well as Sylvia had. She understood me, and said it best. <br><br>Sylvia even writes with clarity about not being able to write. In some sense almost everyone has experienced the dreadful blank page, the cursor blinking on an empty document, the e-mail that you just don&#8217;t know how to begin. Fingers drum the keyboard, but can&#8217;t depress any letters. Sylvia&#8217;s journals keep me company when this happens. She too, even though she wrote voluminously, struggled with feeling empty and unable to push a pen across paper. And when she couldn&#8217;t write, like me, she turned to baked goods! Sylvia created them, while I only consume them, but still I feel we have this in common. <br><br>So why did I write <i>this</i> book, now? Others have already written Sylvia&#8217;s biography. Sylvia&#8217;s own daughter has expressed the opinion that people should leave the story of hermother&#8217;s life alone. How then could I justify writing this book? Why should I convey how I see Sylvia&#8217;s life? <br><br>Honestly, part of writing <i>Your Own, Sylvia</i> was a willful denial on my part of what I was undertaking. How could I possibly write a whole book of poems about Sylvia Plath? They would never hold up under the weight of her talent. But somehow I let that go. I thought about the first time I came to Plath in the classroom. I knew little about her life, not much beyond the fact that she killed herself. And although I admired her writing, I could not initially see its depth. Sylvia&#8217;s work seemed difficult, purposely obtuse, and so I dismissed pieces of hers as remote and even cold. But learning about her life helped me to unpack various themes and metaphors that would otherwise have remained closed to me. Instead of being cold, I saw that Sylvia&#8217;s writing borders on frenzy at times. She holds her work close to her and you feel its heat and impact. I don&#8217;t think it always follows that knowing a writer&#8217;s biography is essential to understanding their work, but the knowledge I gained about Sylvia&#8217;s life as I researched and wrote this book enhanced my experience of her writing. I had always loved her poems&#8217; fabulous opening lines, such as: &#8220;Viciousness in the kitchen,&#8221;-Lesbos ;&#8220;Stasis in darkness,&#8221;-Ariel; and &#8220;Even the sun-clouds this morning cannot manage such skirts&#8221;-Poppies in October. When I found out what was going on in Sylvia&#8217;s life at the time she penned each of these lines, the words resonated with even greater impact. My book offers a window into Sylvia&#8217;s life in the hopes of helping readers appreciate her writing more fully.<br><br>Sylvia published her first poem at eight and wrote until her last days, creating astonishing work whether she was serene, joyful, or in crisis. Her writing captivates and inspires me. She is a friend that is always there on the bookshelf when I need her, with a great line, a brilliant sentence, to pull me through. I wish that her own words could have done the same for her. And I hope my book leads you to her."

Nesbit (and countless other works of fantasy recommended to us by our imperious rouge-cheeked librarian, Mrs. Thackeray)--embarked upon a fantasy epic of our own. We wrote our epic in multi-colored inks (Justine had gotten this nifty set of colored plastic quills for her birthday) in a series of classic black and white composition notebooks, whose white spaces we colored in so that every time we touched them, we got rainbows on our fingertips. I can&#8217;t remember the plot but I do know that it featured a cast of unicorns, elves, fairies, and an evil magician whose name, Pezlar, was inspired by our favorite candy. Our characters lived on islands that were shaped in their own likenesses; for instance, the unicorns lived on an island shaped like a unicorn head, where there was, naturally, a Cape Horn and a Beard Bay. Whenever we had writer&#8217;s block, we simply drew maps. We were writing (and drawing), not so much for posterity as to conjure a world that, we fervently hoped, would one day open its magical portals and take us in. The world shimmered with latent magic and we lived our days in a state of heightened expectation. When would the magic reveal itself?<b><br><br>Those Magical Oldsters<br></b>Taking our cue from the Professor in the Narnia books, Mary Poppins, and Mrs. Pigglewiggle, old people were especially magical to us. Ike Raff, the grumpy old man who owned the cigar store; Charlie Hicks, the seven-foot-tall homeless man who marched in the Memorial Day parade in a full Cherokee regalia, and even the scary Mrs. Thackeray were, we suspected, distinguished emissaries from magical lands. To their credit, they played it straight when, with burning intensity, we asked them such questions as, &#8220;Where do you really come from?&#8221; and &#8220;How did you get here?&#8221; &#8220;Did you fly, teleport, or use a traveling spell?&#8221; <br><br><b>Step right up to the Museum of Magic<br></b>Magical talismans were vitally important to us. We collected beach glass, horse chestnuts, antique buttons, old coins, and even a green crystal doorknob. And, yes, we had our own Museum of Magic that we set up in Justine&#8217;s side yard, which was just across the street from the beach. I say we set it up. I&#8217;m not sure we ever had any paying customers. We were raising funds so that we could buy the fabric to make long hunter-green capes with hoods. These were the outfits we planned to wear when we passed through the magical portals.  We must have raised the funds somehow, because we actually stitched up the capes on my mother&#8217;s sewing machine. How proud we were of them! So you can imagine how crushed we were when we wore them into town one day and somebody asked us which 4-H troupe we belonged to. <br><br><b>Magical Portals<br></b>We looked everywhere for them: Mr. Raff&#8217;s cigar store (where we would later buy our Beatles fan mags), an old wooden boat house down at the beach, an abandoned rococo-baroque Victorian mansion near my house just bristling with magical possibilities.<br>One Friday night, before our favorite TV show, <i>Twilight Zone, </i>came on at 9:30, we took a candle and some matches and made a pilgrimage to the Victorian mansion. It was a cold and windy night, I recall, and when we spied a broken window off the porch, it seemed to say to us, &#8220;Trespass, please!&#8221; With lit candle, we solemnly walked from room to room, searching for the portal. When we got to the third floor landing, the candle suddenly flared up and then guttered. We screamed and tore out of that place back to my mother&#8217;s warm, safe kitchen. Magic, we concluded, was sometimes a pretty scary proposition. We steeled ourselves and determined to make a return trip to the ruined mansion. We never managed that second trip because a wrecker ball rolled in and leveled the site of our closest brush with magic. A branch of the U.S. Post Office took its place and, although we never attempted to break in (Federal Offense!), we did loiter in the foyer, searching for magical signs among the Wanted Posters and the public notices. <br><br><b>Adolescence Rears Its Ugly Head<br></b>Looking back on those years, I see that, for us, magic was a kind of pagan belief system. It was both an affirmation of and an escape from life. But maintaining our belief system was not always easy. It was often downright burdensome. We had our rituals to observe, and our obligations, too. (We held weekly classes for our stuffed animals in the faerie arts, complete with lesson plans and demonstration models). Our beliefs isolated us from the other kids (who already suspected we were more than a little bit tetched). There came a time when a kind of low-grade dread began to steal over us; dread of the day when, like Susan Pevense, we would wake up and want to wear lipstick and stockings. And of course, that day did dawn, slowly enough to be agonizing. It started with the Beatles. We simply redirected all that magical intensity in the direction of the Fab 4. Instead of believing in portals, we believed we would one day not only get to meet them, but get to marry them (Justine, John; me, Paul). After that, it was a just small step to wearing lipstick (well, Mary Quant lip gloss, in any case), stockings (fish net), mini skirts (tweed and veddy British) and, before we knew it, we were looking back on our days of magic with patronizing fondness. <br><br><b>Reader, I Wrote<br></b>When I grew up, I still wanted to write but writing for children seemed, well, childish. I determined to be a writer of Adult Books, and succeeded (on a very modest level). But what can I tell you? The lack of magic in the adult world, as much from a reader&#8217;s standpoint as a writer&#8217;s, eventually got to me. I missed the magic, and years later, here I am, drawn back to its portals. I even find myself believing again. I believe that the world in which we live, the world of consensus reality, is but one small room in a mansion full of rooms. I believe that writing and reading are two surefire ways to get access to the other rooms. And nowadays, it is my sole ambition to grow up to be one of those old people who just might be mistaken for a distinguished emissary from a magical land. <br>Do I fly, teleport, or cast traveling spells? <br>The answer to all of the above is yes!"

When in doubt, keep it simple: here are a few insights into who I am and how I work. Ultimately, it&#8217;s all about the words and pictures and how they come to be.<br><br>Today, I write books and teach in San Francisco, but I&#8217;m a Chicago boy at heart. In the late-1970s, at the age of four, I moved to the Chicago suburbs. My formative memories are generally pretty pleasant; a mishmash of baseball, bikes, and bad haircuts while I navigated the social labyrinth of public schools. As a history teacher, I now realize that my childhood was typical of an American kid growing up in the 1980s: middle child of divorced parents, microwaving fish sticks, and watching too much television.<br><br>Thankfully, it wasn&#8217;t all fish sticks and TV. There were always books and I was a big reader. My parents were art historians and there was a lot of strange stuff to spark and stoke an inquisitive mind&#8211;books on Bosch and Beowulf, surrealist paintings, visiting artists, and mounds of comic books. It was rich fodder for a young mind and while I didn&#8217;t always understand what I was looking at, I knew I liked it.<br><br>I was an artist before I was a writer. We had a big drawing board at the Neff house&#8211;a battered, scribbled-over panel of wood that I would lay out on the floor. With pencil, pen, crayon, or markers, I would create whole worlds&#8211;taped together panoramas of monsters and knights and smoldering ruins. I loved monsters&#8211;from Grendel lurking outside Hrothgar&#8217;s hall, to the Minotaur, to the motley host in Sendak&#8217;s, <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>. If it had claws and teeth and malicious intent, I wanted to draw it. Still do.<br><br>My love of words came later. I don&#8217;t know exactly what triggered it, but I love the sounds, shapes, and mental snapshots that words can conjure. From the roar of creation myths to the quiet precision of a poem, there&#8217;s magic in words. The written word makes me feel a fierce connection to other people&#8211;I get to experience life through the soul and vitality of another human being. Even as you read these words, a connection is forming between us. We might be separated by great gulfs of distance or time, but still the connection exists. If that&#8217;s not magic, I don&#8217;t know what is.<br><br>While I love words and art, I didn&#8217;t make a go of them right away. As a senior at Cornell University, I planned to attend law school when I was contacted by a consulting firm and encouraged to apply for an interview. Upon further inspection, McKinsey &amp; Company sounded like heady stuff&#8211;a chance to work with smart people while tackling big problems. I decided law school could wait.<br><br>I spent five years in the business world and it was fine, but it just wasn&#8217;t me. Despite some brilliant colleagues and intriguing projects, I was plagued by the nagging suspicion that I was wasting my life. The real me wasn&#8217;t all that interested in a corner office&#8211;I wanted to be back at my drawing board, creating monsters and knights and ruins. Some might call such an impulse &#8220;geeky&#8221; or &#8220;childish,&#8221; but the older I get, the more I realize that we&#8217;re all strange little creatures and you have to build a life around whatever strange little things make you tick. It took nearly 30 years, but I finally concluded that I am a storyteller. I quit the corporate life cold turkey and took up teaching. During my first year teaching high school, I began to write <i>The Tapestry</i>.<br><br><i>The Tapestry </i>is a story that I would have loved as a boy. I don&#8217;t know how to write for an audience other than myself and I think the story would ring false if I tried. A fair amount of personal history is interwoven into the tale and its characters. For example, <i>vyes</i> are the byproduct of bad dreams I had as a boy, involving tall, wolfish creatures with squinty eyes. The nightmares were recurring and I would run into my parents&#8217; room, insisting that the &#8220;vyes&#8221; were after me. Naturally, when I needed a monster for <i>The Tapestry</i>, I put a call into the vyes. It was the least they could do after tormenting me so.<br><br>There are other bits and pieces of my life scattered throughout the books. An elderly married couple that I knew during college inspired the characters of Mum and Bob. A girlfriend&#8217;s father once asked me if I had read Dante in the original Italian (I had not). The presence of Old Tom at Rowan&#8211;its clock tower and its chimes&#8211;are a nod to Cornell&#8217;s Uris Library where I spent many an hour drowsing and watching snow settle onto the campus below. The list could go on. While personal anecdotes are nice, historic epics and mythology play a far greater role in shaping <i>The Tapestry</i>.<br><br>I must have been 10 or 11 when I first stumbled upon a book of Irish myths. Compared to the familiar fare of Greek and Norse mythology, the Irish tales seemed very exotic. Ireland&#8217;s stories and heroes possessed a beauty, savagery, and poetry that were magical, as were the names, which I still find a challenge. Central to Irish mythology is the hero, C&#250;chulain, and I could not ask for a more heroic or human persona on which to base Max McDaniels. In many ways, C&#250;chulain is the epitome of the tragic hero&#8211;he possesses both supernatural power and human foibles and thus makes for a fascinating character study. The myth of the <i>Tain Bo Cualnge</i>, or, <i>The Cattle Raid of Cooley</i>, likewise offered intriguing opportunities to explore heroism and hubris side by side.<br><br>The series also incorporates other genres&#8211;fantasy, science fiction, and real history&#8211;and the mix of these elements will shift from book to book. As a writer, I find the variety energizing as each new volume presents fundamentally new challenges and opportunities. To date, I&#8217;ve fleshed out detailed plans for over half a dozen books&#8211;some of which precede <i>The Hound of Rowan</i> by centuries&#8211;and I can safely say that no two are alike. I&#8217;d find each a joy to write because I&#8217;d find each a joy to read. This same mentality is applied to the illustrations.<br><br>When it comes to the drawings, I&#8217;m of the old school. Each of <i>The Tapestry&#8217;</i>s<i> </i>illustrations is a piece of original art. There is no PhotoShop&#8211;an application that has its uses, but is as pervasive these days as cosmetic surgery. I&#8217;d rather have a flawed drawing with a bit of sweat and fingerprints than a super-slick image that lives only on a server. The latter makes me sad. I have tremendous admiration for the work of some earlier illustrators&#8211;artists like Sydney Paget, Thomas Nast, and Arthur Rackham. I still pore over their drawings or political cartoons with love and awe and I&#8217;m firmly of the belief that the craft hit its zenith in the 19th and early 20th centuries. I try to emulate these old masters, employing the same tools&#8211;if not quite the same skills&#8211;in the illustration process. The drawings are created with an old-fashioned dip pen, paintbrushes, and washes of India ink applied to hot-pressed watercolor paper. Someday I&#8217;d like to work with color, but I don&#8217;t see that happening within this series.<br><br>There you have it&#8211;a little glimpse into my background, the stories I tell, and the pictures I make. I hope it&#8217;s just the beginning and that I will have the opportunity to spend the rest of my life writing books and teaching young people. I can&#8217;t imagine anything better."

I had finished a middle-grade novel, <i>The World&#8217;s Most Disgusting Sandwich</i>, and was trying to get it published.<br>&#8220;It has potential,&#8221; a potential agent told me. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to see other books you&#8217;ve written.&#8221;<br>Other books I&#8217;d written? I hadn&#8217;t written any other books. I had written an anonymous poetry column for a teachers&#8217; newsletter. I had written a bunch of essays in college and graduate school. I had written some irreverent songs to play on my guitar. &#8220;This is my first book,&#8221; I confessed. <br>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we don&#8217;t typically represent books, we represent writers. Are you working on something else?&#8221;<br>I had started on a sequel and began to tell her about it.<br>&#8220;I mean something different,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to see what else you can do.&#8221;<br>Oh, crap. &#8220;I have a few other ideas,&#8221; I said. <br>She told me when I had something written she&#8217;d be happy to take a look.<br>So I came up with a new idea in a hurry and started writing the fictional memoir of Zeke Zagger, the world&#8217;s greatest super villain that nobody had ever heard of. It was supposed to be funny; instead it was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful. Reading over the first 20 pages, I began to worry about the state of my subconscious. <br><br>So I decided to try again with a new character, and the first thing I wanted to do was give him a name. Shakespeare. Shakespeare Shapiro. Wow, I thought, imagine being that kid. So I did imagine it, and I started to vent on paper. It turned out Shakespeare Shapiro had a lot to say, not just about his name, but also about his crazy parents, his maddeningly popular younger brother, his social ineptitude, and the overall catastrophe of his life. Much of what he said was depraved, disturbing, and utterly distasteful; but it was also really funny to me. And I guess it was funny to other people, too, because <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is set to hit the bookstores on September 25, 2007.<br><br>As an eighth-grade teacher, it is both incredibly exciting and a little bit nerve wracking to have written a book that I know my students&#8211;and probably their parents&#8211;will read. I&#8217;m excited to become a minor celebrity for the first time in my life, at least within the walls of Manhattan&#8217;s Middle School 255. I&#8217;m excited that my students will see me as a real live writer, and I will be thrilled if more of them are inspired to carry on independent writing lives. But I wonder how they and their parents will react to the fact that the book deals so openly with the kinds of things teenage boys think about. Just imagine parent-teacher conferences, if you will: <br> <br><b>PARENT #1</b>: So, Jake, we read your book.<br><br><b>ME</b> (<i>smiling nervously)</i>: Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you how Becky is doing in class. Her writing is&#8211;<br><br><b>PARENT #2 </b><i>(holding up a copy)</i>: Masturbation. Drug use. Pornography. You seem quite well versed in these subjects . . .<br><br>You get the idea. So to the question of how much of <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is autobiographical, let me just say that nothing has ever been proven. And as to the rumors that I&#8217;m now working on a musical called <i>Castration Celebration</i>, I&#8217;ll have to plead the fifth."

Barbara Park arrived at the writing profession through an indirect route. Before becoming a bestselling and beloved children&rsquo;s author, she originally intended to teach high school history and political science. She got her secondary education degree but quickly realized that her calling was to be a writer.&nbsp;

&nbsp;
She went on to write over&nbsp;50 books, from the picture book&nbsp;<i>Ma! There&rsquo;s Nothing to Do Here!</i>, a love letter to her grandson, to middle grade novels such as&nbsp;<i>Skinnybones, The Kid in the Red Jacket, Mick Harte Was Here,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Graduation of Jake Moon.</i>&nbsp;Barbara&nbsp;won more than&nbsp;40 children&rsquo;s book awards, including several Children&rsquo;s Choice Awards.&nbsp;

Barbara Park was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey, on April 21, 1947, and spent most of her adult life in Arizona. There she, with her husband, Richard, raised her two sons and spent time with her two young grandsons.&nbsp;Park died on November 15, 2013 after fighting ovarian cancer heroically for seven and a half years."

 Jonathan London started writing poetry in his late teens. Although he received a Masters Degree in Social Sciences and never formally studied literature or creative writing, he began to consider himself a ""writer"" about the time he graduated from college. After college, he became a dancer in a modern dance company and worked at numerous low-paying jobs as a laborer or counselor.
 
 However, during this 20-year period, London continued to write. He wrote poems and short stories for adults, earning next to nothing despite being published in many literary magazines. ""It wasn't until I had kids of my own that I became a writer for children,"" he explains. ""It all started with telling them stories when they were very young. I wrote down one of these stories, and it became&nbsp;<i>The Owl Who Became the Moon</i>, my first picture book sale (though it was my fourth to appear in print). Now I am finally making a living as a writer. A dream come true!""
 
 Born a ""Navy brat"" in Brooklyn, New York,&nbsp;London was raised on naval stations throughout the US and Puerto Rico. Today he lives with his wife, Maureen, and their two sons, Aaron and Sean, in rural Northern California, where they like to backpack in the summer, play in the snow in winter, and dance all year around."

Her parents, aunts and uncles and grandparents were all forced out of their homes after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when all Japanese Canadians on Canada&rsquo;s West Coast were, she says, &ldquo;herded into the exhibition grounds in Vancouver where for several months they slept in horse stalls.&rdquo; Able-bodied men were then sent away to work, the others transported to live in camps of tarpaper shacks in the mountains. When the war ended with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japanese Canadians were allowed to resettle only in designated areas of eastern Canada. Sakamoto&rsquo;s grandparents lost the homes and businesses they had worked so hard to acquire.<br><br> Kerri grew up in mostly white suburban Etobicoke of the 1960s and &rsquo;70s; her parents avoided talking about the camps, or even about Japanese culture and history, even though racial taunts were a fact of life. She found out about the internment camps at the age of twenty, reading a magazine article. She read Joy Kogawa&rsquo;s <i>Obasan</i> and worked with Kogawa in the redress movement for two years, although her parents refused to attend the meetings. &ldquo;It was the idea of being visible once again that was uncomfortable for them.&rdquo; She felt compelled to write about the internment and its residual effects.<br><br> She had studied English and French at the University of Toronto, published some short stories, but then wasn&rsquo;t sure how she would make a living. She worked in a range of jobs, often in libraries. Aged thirty, panicking about whether she would ever become a writer, she applied and was accepted to the creative writing program at New York University, where she studied with E.L. Doctorow and Peter Carey. She stayed in New York for six years, enjoying the talks and readings and films, and wrote about art for a gallery. By the time her work permit ran out, exciting things were happening in Canadian literature and she felt optimistic about returning to Canada; soon after her return, <i>The Electrical Field</i>, which she began writing while at NYU, was accepted for publication.<br><br> Kerri&rsquo;s second novel, <i>One Hundred Million Hearts,</i> examined the many Canadian- and American-born Japanese men who were in Japan at the start of the war and joined the military. Suffering racism in North America but aliens in Japan, they were not accepted anywhere. &ldquo;It was absolutely conceivable that some of the kamikaze might have been American- or Canadian-born&hellip; I think if you&rsquo;re anxious to prove your authenticity and your allegiance, what more definitive way to do that?&rdquo; She spent four months of 1999 in Japan doing research. Unable to speak the language, she experienced being a cultural outsider as she visited war museums, and tracked down memoirs and wartime propaganda. The novel, which took five years to complete, reflects her interest in memory and the splintering of history. <br> &#160;<br> Kerri&rsquo;s third novel, <i>Floating City, </i>tells the story of a fiercely ambitious boy who overcomes humble beginnings and hardship in British Columbia to become a wealthy property developer in Toronto, but cannot escape the ghosts of his past. While the novel&rsquo;s early inspiration came from family history, its scope expanded dramatically when Kerri learned that visionary American architect Buckminster Fuller had once designed a futuristic development that included floating housing pods in Toronto harbour. Fuller appears in the book as the protagonist&rsquo;s mentor, giving rise to one of its many conflicts&mdash;altruism versus ambition, modernity versus tradition, and clashing ideas about belonging and inclusion."

Four years later, they moved to Ottawa where he was raised  on stories told by his father and the works of C.S. Lewis and Roald Dahl, and developed  aspirations to become a writer. Acknowledging that he hadn&rsquo;t seen enough of the world  to create great literary works, Lam enrolled in medical school at the University  of Toronto, hoping it would provide real-life experience and a wealth of rich material.  His plan proved to be a very good one.<br><br> It was while working as a doctor aboard an  Arctic cruise that Lam had a chance encounter with renowned author Margaret Atwood.  She agreed to read his short stories, and later sent him an email announcing &ldquo;Congratulations.  You can write.&rdquo; Atwood mentored the young author, and was instrumental in bringing  Lam to his publisher, Doubleday Canada. <br><br> <br> While crafting his debut collection of  short stories, Lam worked in the emergency room at Toronto East General Hospital  and helped fight the 2003 SARS outbreak. &ldquo;An emergency physician is often in the  centre of a storm of tensions and drama,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We work in a world that is both  medical and personal, where the stakes are high and events are unpredictable. As  a doctor, I respond to the world around me, and act within that world. As a writer,  I do something fresh and new on the page.&rdquo;<br><br> Lam&rsquo;s depiction of four medical students  who become doctors in <b>Bloodletting &amp; Miraculous Cures</b> was so unique and accomplished  that the collection won the 2006 Scotiabank Giller Prize &ndash; Canada&rsquo;s most prestigious  literary award. He is the youngest writer, and the only first-time author, to win  it. <br><br> Next up is Lam&rsquo;s first novel, <b>Cholon, Near Forgotten</b>, which follows a Chinese  man in Saigon, headmaster of an English school as well as a compulsive gambler, during  the Vietnam War. Shaftesbury Films is currently developing <b>Bloodletting &amp; Miraculous  Cures</b> into a TV drama series for The Movie Network and Lam will act as a consultant  while continuing to work as an emergency physician in Toronto, where he lives with  his wife and son.<br><br>Dr. Vincent Lam is available for select readings and lectures.

Because she tells dangerous truths. &#8220;This is what it is like to be complete. It is horrible.&#8221; <br><br>Sylvia forges through the crests and the crashes of self-examination for us on her pages. Her writing binds me to her, close, under her skull and skin. And I think that may be one of the primary things great writing can do&#8211; become your companion.<br><br>And what an insightful companion she is! Tossing off lines like &#8220;The courage of a shut mouth, in spite of artillery!&#8221; When I read, &#8220;It was a place of force&#8212;the wind gagging my mouth with my own blown hair,&#8221; her expression of <i>my own experiences </i>seemed uncanny. I have lived in that boxed space of being in a relationship with someone by choice and yet feeling that I had no choice but to stay, as I had willingly put myself in that cage. And yet when I wrote about this, my own words did not express my feelings as well as Sylvia had. She understood me, and said it best. <br><br>Sylvia even writes with clarity about not being able to write. In some sense almost everyone has experienced the dreadful blank page, the cursor blinking on an empty document, the e-mail that you just don&#8217;t know how to begin. Fingers drum the keyboard, but can&#8217;t depress any letters. Sylvia&#8217;s journals keep me company when this happens. She too, even though she wrote voluminously, struggled with feeling empty and unable to push a pen across paper. And when she couldn&#8217;t write, like me, she turned to baked goods! Sylvia created them, while I only consume them, but still I feel we have this in common. <br><br>So why did I write <i>this</i> book, now? Others have already written Sylvia&#8217;s biography. Sylvia&#8217;s own daughter has expressed the opinion that people should leave the story of hermother&#8217;s life alone. How then could I justify writing this book? Why should I convey how I see Sylvia&#8217;s life? <br><br>Honestly, part of writing <i>Your Own, Sylvia</i> was a willful denial on my part of what I was undertaking. How could I possibly write a whole book of poems about Sylvia Plath? They would never hold up under the weight of her talent. But somehow I let that go. I thought about the first time I came to Plath in the classroom. I knew little about her life, not much beyond the fact that she killed herself. And although I admired her writing, I could not initially see its depth. Sylvia&#8217;s work seemed difficult, purposely obtuse, and so I dismissed pieces of hers as remote and even cold. But learning about her life helped me to unpack various themes and metaphors that would otherwise have remained closed to me. Instead of being cold, I saw that Sylvia&#8217;s writing borders on frenzy at times. She holds her work close to her and you feel its heat and impact. I don&#8217;t think it always follows that knowing a writer&#8217;s biography is essential to understanding their work, but the knowledge I gained about Sylvia&#8217;s life as I researched and wrote this book enhanced my experience of her writing. I had always loved her poems&#8217; fabulous opening lines, such as: &#8220;Viciousness in the kitchen,&#8221;-Lesbos ;&#8220;Stasis in darkness,&#8221;-Ariel; and &#8220;Even the sun-clouds this morning cannot manage such skirts&#8221;-Poppies in October. When I found out what was going on in Sylvia&#8217;s life at the time she penned each of these lines, the words resonated with even greater impact. My book offers a window into Sylvia&#8217;s life in the hopes of helping readers appreciate her writing more fully.<br><br>Sylvia published her first poem at eight and wrote until her last days, creating astonishing work whether she was serene, joyful, or in crisis. Her writing captivates and inspires me. She is a friend that is always there on the bookshelf when I need her, with a great line, a brilliant sentence, to pull me through. I wish that her own words could have done the same for her. And I hope my book leads you to her."

One way to respond is to say: &quot;I've only written the one book. But I've read&#8230; several.&quot; Said in the right way, it can be pretty funny. You pause, make your eyes go a bit wry, yet serious, and slightly emphasize the word &quot;several.&quot; See, &quot;several&quot; sounds like too few books to have read when you're going around saying you're an author. <i>But of course</i>, the questioner thinks, <i>he could be kidding. Couldn't he</i>? If things go according to plan, the next question will be: &quot;What is your favorite book you've ever read?&quot;  You can answer with a question of your own: &quot;you mean all the way through?&quot; Then look a bit stumped. With any luck, the original question will have been forgotten by then, and you can go back to whatever you were doing.<br><br>But I'm going to break with my usual policy here and be perfectly honest: the reason for trying to wriggle out of that question by acting like an idiot is that I don't know the answer. It's not like I &quot;decided&quot; to write a YA novel. The way it happened was, I had misspent pretty much my entire life writing songs for my punk rock band. I had a cult following. One former cult member became a literary agent when he grew up (they do that sometimes - grow up, I mean) and he had the idea that the sort of characters, themes, and turns of phrase that pop up in my songs of arrested adolescent angst might make a pretty good book. I was skeptical but I said I'd give it a shot. I procrastinated for a long, long time. Then one day I started typing and, somehow, through a process I neither understand nor even really remember all that well, the stuff I was typing turned into a novel about a teenager. And, <i>voil&#224;</i>, (if, <i>voil&#224;</i> is the right word), I became a YA novelist. Actually, <i>voil&#224;</i> is definitely not the right word, because it took almost two years in the end, and it was kind of hard. It was like watching grass grow while hitting your head against a rock.<br><br>To continue the unfamiliar technique of being perfectly honest, I'll admit something else: I have, in fact, read a lot more than several YA novels. Like many kids with no friends, I spent a whole lot of time reading. I mean, books were my friends, and I would commune with them in the hallowed halls of my Imagination. Not really - that was a kind of joke. But I had a lot of time on my hands, and what else are you going to do when there's nothing on TV? Like most people, I began flirting with the YA genre by reading the sexy books that I was supposed to be too young for, particularly the ones about girls (there weren't actually all that many sexy ones concerning boys) as a kind of research project for a potential future career as a Great Lover of Women. Most of what I imagined I learned about girls and human relationships from these books, admittedly, turned out to be almost wholly inaccurate, but never mind. Then, when I was the age you're supposed to be when you read teen lit, I tended to avoid it and read &quot;adult books&quot; and &quot;classics&quot; instead. <br><br>Then as an older teenager, I worked at the local public library. That job was, once again, like being a kid with no friends, in that I tended to have a lot of time on my hands. So, for something to do in the down time, I assigned myself a little project of reading every book in the Children's Fiction section, from beginning to end, in alphabetical order. I didn't love them all, but I loved a lot of them. (My favorites were darker, psychological studies like those of Robert Cormier, or ultra-wacky stuff like Ellen Raskin&#8212;but I gave everything a shot.) I continued to read YA books through my alleged adulthood. And now I read them not only for enjoyment and what I think they call &quot;enrichment,&quot; but also out of professional interest, i.e., checking out the competition. <br><br>I have been too young, too old, then way too old, but in a lifetime of doing things I'm technically not supposed to do, few forbidden experiences have been as powerful, as inspiring, or as cool as this habit of always reading the wrong books. And now I'm writing them, too. Long live age-inappropriateness."

Crutcher claims his parents &#8220;were in Cascade before I got dry,&#8221; referring to Cascade, Idaho, the small lumber and logging town of about 950 people where he was raised.<br><br>As a youth, ALAN Award&#8211;winning and six-time ALA award-winning author Chris Crutcher was not an outstanding student. He attributes his academic non-achievements to having an older brother who was &#8220;real bright. He was the valedictorian of the class, and I don&#8217;t think he got anything under an A minus the whole time he was in high school. I got a good picture of what that was like and decided I didn&#8217;t want anything to do with it.&#8221;<br><br>Not many people, least of all anyone connected with his education, would have imagined that Crutcher would ever become a writer. Though both of his parents were voracious readers, reading was not one of Chris&#8217;s favorite pastimes. In fact, he read a grand total of one book from cover to cover during his entire four years of high school. When it came to writing book reports, he invented titles for reports, as well as stories to go with them, and often got his authors from the pages of the Boise telephone directory. He also copied from his brother. Many times, Chris would &#8220;take one of his [brother&#8217;s] book reports and misspell a few words, take it &#8216;down&#8217; a few notches, and turn it in.&#8221;<br><br>After high school, Crutcher attended Eastern Washington State College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology/sociology. Chris admits he naively thought he could just turn up at the college of his choice on opening day and register. Upon learning in senior year that applications were necessary, &#8220;I ran down to the library. All the college catalogs were either black or blue, and Eastern&#8217;s was red, so I took it.&#8221;<br><br>After graduation, he roamed around the country with a friend for a year. Then he went back to school for a teaching certificate. He spent nearly 10 years in Oakland, California, as Director of a K&#8211;12 alternative school for inner-city kids. In 1980, Crutcher moved back to Washington and settled in Spokane, where he works as a child and family therapist in a mental health center, focusing on child-abuse cases.<br><br>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t start writing until I was 35. It&#8217;s hard to imagine my life not writing. I love it. There&#8217;s really a part of it that&#8217;s connection. When you&#8217;re watching somebody read your material and they smile and nod, you know you&#8217;ve found that place where your experience and their experience match, even though they aren&#8217;t the same exact experience. Any time I write something and you say, &#8216;Yah,&#8217; boy, it&#8217;s a kick!&#8221;<br><br>Chris Crutcher&#8217;s novels are a reflection of real life as he sees it. As in real life, his novels combine humor with difficult and serious situations. He draws heavily on his own experiences and on elements that have surrounded his life. For example, the tiny lumber town of Cascade, Idaho, where Crutcher grew up became the fictional village of Trout, Idaho, in his novel <i>Running Loose</i>. His experiences working for the alternative school in Oakland formed the basis of <i>The Crazy Horse Electric Game</i>. And the emphasis on swimming in <i>Stotan!</i> comes directly from Crutcher&#8217;s own involvement in this sport in college.<br><br>His book <i>Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes</i> was praised by <i>School Library Journal</i> in a starred review as &#8220;a masterpiece.&#8221; In this darkly funny, suspenseful novel about friendship, a high-school senior tries to help his badly scarred best friend, Sarah Byrnes, deal with a horrific event in her past.<br><br><br><b>PRAISE<br><br></b>ATHLETIC SHORTS <br>&#8220;A winning collection of stories. . . .

I sure do. It makes you feel a part of something important. Reciprocally, it&#8217;s fun to learn intimate details about other settings, other lands, or other worlds through fiction. I&#8217;m not sure which is best. In writing <i>Cuba 15</i>, my novel about a Cuban American girl interested in her past, I was able to savor the thrill of hometown recognition and the intrigue of a far-off place, and pass them on to readers. These elements hold a special meaning for young people who want to write. <br><br>Beginning writers are always told to &#8220;write what you know.&#8221; The question is, with limited years behind you, what do you know well enough to write about? Without fail, everyone has a beginning. You might start there. What&#8217;s your early history, in twenty words or less? I was born in Chicago, and my family moved to the south suburbs when I was five years old. Though I didn&#8217;t set out to write a book about the area, Chicago and the suburbs are part of the foundation for <i>Cuba 15</i>.<br><br>See? You probably know enough about yourself to begin writing a fictional setting. But I think that a good story entails writing<i> beyond</i> what one knows. I like to use realistic details, such as setting, as a jumping off point and then go on to explore mysteries or what-ifs. Though my father is from Cuba, I grew up in a very &#8220;American&#8221; household, so in writing <i>Cuba 15</i> I first had to admit how much I <i>didn&#8217;t</i> know about Cuba and my family history. As I learned, a book began to take shape. I considered what it would be like to grow up <i>with</i> that information. And my main character, Violet Paz, was born.<br><br>Although the research and writing process was long and complex, I was fascinated to see where my knowledge and ignorance collided or overlapped. Things that used to seem so black and white were suddenly every shade in between. The realization that I was the culmination of three selves&#8212;American, Cuban, and Cuban American&#8212;gave me wings. And as Violet came to this same realization on the page, I stopped struggling so much with my own identity.<br><br>Writing about others is a great way to learn, because the questions just keep coming, begging for answers. Considering some questions, however, requires special bravery. Setting this book in and around my hometown helped to bring my fears of the unknown&#8212;my Cuban roots, the current relationship between the U.S. and Cuba&#8212;down to earth, to make them smaller. And so I was able to address the question of Cuban American identity. The 61,500-word response became <i>Cuba 15</i>, and it all started because I wondered about where I came from.<br><br>In the novel, Violet notes that her father already knows where he belongs on the family tree: &#8220;The rest of us have to find out for ourselves what being Cuban is about.&#8221; If I could, I&#8217;d tell Violet that, while knowledge may be power, ignorance is the greatest teacher.<br><br>Maybe she should write a book.<br><br><i>Nancy Osa learned to write novels, break rules, and appreciate the absurd while at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.

Readers&#8211;and aspiring writers&#8211;are often curious about what inspires a story and from where authors get their ideas. How did <i>Cuba 15 </i>originate? Did you draw from experiences with your own family and adolescence? <br>A.</b> Like Violet, I had to actively learn about my Cuban side. While my American Cuban family may have eaten turkey and <i>frijoles negros </i>on Thanksgiving, we were more &#8220;apple pie&#8221; than &#8220;flan.&#8221;<i> </i>When I started researching Cuban culture in order to write a novel, I was thunderstruck to find that I had never heard of the <i>quincea&#241;ero</i> tradition. I never celebrated Sweet Sixteen, either. Not exactly a social superstar, I wondered how I would have reacted if I had been faced with a <i>quince </i>party to plan. That&#8217;s where Violet came in. I think she handled it all fabulously. That&#8217;s where we differ&#8211;she&#8217;s stronger, and funnier, than I am. But I gave her a lot of help. Yes, there are some reflections of my family in the Pazes . . . although I never met my Cuban grandparents.<br><br><b>Q. Violet experiences a lot of anxiety regarding her role in the <i>quincea&#241;ero </i>and her performances for speech class. Do you ever experience writer&#8217;s anxiety, or moments of doubt regarding your work?<br>A.</b> A writer&#8217;s life is so filled with doubt and risk on the business side that it leaves no room for creative doubt. The phrase &#8220;finding one&#8217;s voice&#8221; means that a writer gains the knowledge needed to arrive at a style that works for her. All she can do is write with all the honesty and trust she can muster. Obviously, it&#8217;s not a scientific process, so of course I make many false starts. But, whether a work is published or not, everything I write becomes part of my pool of creative resources, to which I can return at any time. When I am unsure of which direction to go with a story, I use my time-tested remedy: Think about it. <i>Then </i>write. I also find that discussing work in progress is vital. Early readers keep a writer honest and on track. Belonging to a fantastic writers&#8217; group keeps me down to earth <i>and </i>propels me to higher heights than I could ever scale alone. And it feels great when I can make them laugh.<br><b><br>Q. On that note, do you ever get up onstage and perform as Violet does? <br>A.</b> Hmm. I wrote, directed, and starred in my first play when I was in third grade. In grade school classes and Girl Scouts, I reigned as the queen of skits. Puppet shows, horse shows, piano recitals . . . yep, I guess I am and always have been a performer. I enjoyed mild success in Original Comedy and Reader&#8217;s Theater on my high school speech team, and now I enjoy performing slices of <i>Cuba 15</i> for readers at book events, complete with all the voices, drama, and humor involved. When I write, it&#8217;s like performing for myself, inside my mind. Though sometimes I find myself laughing or crying out loud!<br><br><b>Q. Violet has keen comic perception. Where do you get your sense of humor? Ever think of becoming a stand-up comic?<br>A.</b> Cubans have a unique sense of humor, and some of it seems to have flared up in me. I use humor in my writing because it puts the reader at ease and makes learning&#8211;a wonderful side effect of reading&#8211;more fun. I have always loved stand-up comedy; George Carlin and Steve Martin are my idols. But there wasn&#8217;t much of a comedy scene for women until I had already become interested in writing fiction. Some of my comic chops were cut in a college playwriting class; my professor passed on a good instinct for slapstick. <i>Pa-dum-pum!</i><br><br><b>Q. How did you become interested in the politics and history of Cuba? How can the average kid become informed and involved in foreign policy issues like this? <br>A.</b> I have family in Cuba whom I have never met, and this is a direct effect of U.S. foreign policy. When I began corresponding with my Cuban relatives as an adult, I faced many legal and cultural hurdles. Suddenly I needed to know why ordinary citizens&#8211;family members&#8211;in both countries were still being kept apart. As an American born between the 1959 Cuban revolution and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis (which posed a direct threat to the United States), I had only a hazy notion of the bad blood between the two countries. When I tried to send pens and paper to my cousins in Cuba, to ensure that they could answer my letters, I was refused. The postal clerk told me small packages were not allowed, and told me to &#8220;say hi to Castro.&#8221; Dealing with postal regulations and ignorant remarks brought the whole international affair down to a personal level. <br>In learning more about the longstanding embargo that restricts trade and travel between the U.S. and Cuba, I was impressed by the efforts of IFCO/Pastors for Peace. This organization [IFCO stands for Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization] has been challenging the embargo and promoting cultural exchange and peace with Cuba since 1992. Local Cuba groups across the country work with Pastors for Peace to change the laws and circumstances that divide rather than unite neighbors and families. Kids fit right in with such humanitarian efforts. They&#8217;re in the process of discovering their places in society and are natural bridge builders. But the simple act of learning more about a &#8220;forbidden&#8221; culture is a first step in reconciliation.<br><br><b>Q. Se&#241;ora Flora asks Violet &#8220;How do you see yourself?&#8221; Violet defines herself by what she is and what she isn&#8217;t. How would you define yourself in these terms? Do you have any &#8220;half talents&#8221; you&#8217;re still growing?<br>A.</b> How do I see myself? Well, first of all, I&#8217;m not the <i>quince</i> type. I don&#8217;t wear dresses or high heels&#8211;you&#8217;re more apt to find me in jodhpurs and boots. I would generally rather be alone at my desk or on horseback than onstage in front of an audience. But I am at home in a lot of environments. I like to get lost in the crowd on a downtown city street as well as lost in thought in the woods. I&#8217;ll also strike up a conversation with just about anyone, to share a little bit of life or get a fresh insight. &#8220;Half talents&#8221; are my specialty, and they make for lifelong learning: That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m glad my Spanish, my horseback riding, and my cooking can really use some work! As a writer, my half talent is exploring human nature, for I can never truly comprehend all its subtleties. But I can keep trying.<br><br><b>Q. Abuela asserts that it is women who carry tradition forward and see that it lives on. Do you agree with her? If so, why do you think this role often falls to women? <br>A.</b> I was thinking about food and holiday events, which are most often women&#8217;s domain. Even though my mother is not Cuban, she learned to cook my father&#8217;s favorite Cuban dishes. So when I was growing up, a lot of Cuban culture was served up in the form of <i>congr&#237;s, arroz con pollo, </i>and<i> lechon asado.</i> Visiting a cousin&#8217;s house in Miami one year, I encountered the Cuban tradition of eating twelve grapes at midnight on New Year&#8217;s. Most of my Cuban traditions came to me through food, as part of a gustatory collective unconscious. Who makes the Thanksgiving turkey or Christmas ham in your house? Who plans the get-togethers? Maybe Dad, but in years past the women stayed home and made these tasks part of their day, while the men went out and earned a living for their families. So perpetuating tradition through food and family gatherings was what women did. Nowadays, this type of traditional learning is probably fading away. Who spends two days marinating and slow-cooking a roast when they can microwave a fajita? (Answer: the author.)<br><b><br>Q. Do you recall an experience or a moment of realization in your young life that made you feel you had grown up? <br>A.</b> No. I didn&#8217;t have an <i>aha! </i>realization until I was thirty-seven, and, you know, that was right for me. Coming-of-age ceremonies were probably begun as a practical means of keeping young girls from becoming mothers too early. While the focus was on honoring the girl, the event may also have been a social tool for restraint aimed at men, in much the same way that other social taboos work. Violet&#8217;s <i>quincea&#241;ero </i>is not grounded in this tradition but does embrace the goal of moving a young woman toward her next phase in life. For Violet, all that process really takes is some thought and action: considering who she&#8217;d like to be, and then trying to effect that. Some people can do that at fifteen. It took me a while longer.<br><br><b>Q. Are you good at dominoes? What are the highest stakes you&#8217;ve ever played for?<br>A.</b> When it comes to poker, backgammon, and dominoes, luck is my friend, strategy a stranger. The highest stakes I&#8217;ve ever played for? My good image and ten cents. I probably lost on both counts.<br><br><b>Q. What would be the theme of your <i>quincea&#241;ero</i>? What would you include in the ceremony to make it reflect your personality (or just for fun)?<br>A.</b> My theme would be &#8220;Let the Good Times Roll.&#8221; I would enjoy blending all the elements of my roots&#8211;there would be Cuban music, Chicago blues, and food from both ends of that spectrum. Instead of a planned agenda, guests would encounter roving entertainers&#8211;an improv troupe, fire jugglers, Latin dancers&#8211;and have fun with a giant maze, an arts-and-crafts station, and a go-cart track. And, of course, before the cake was cut, there would probably be some sort of a performance by the <i>quince</i>-babe herself . . . dressed in her jodhpurs and boots.<br><br><br><br><b>PRAISE</b><br><b><br></b>CUBA 15<b><br><br></b>&#8212;Winner of the Delacorte Press Prize for a First Young Adult Novel<br><br>&#8220;I love the rambunctious, funny voice of this novel.

My parents are both writers. Our dinner table has always been where the events of the day are reported with great hilarity or drama, sometimes both at once. That taught us about pacing, delivery, what works and what doesn't. We read a lot. Possibly because we had no TV. <br><br><b>So dinner was a long series of teachable moments?</b><br>We didn't know we were learning and my parents didn't know they were teaching. It was just dinner. My siblings and I were brought up to value original thinking, honorable behavior, laughter, and books. Our passions were taken seriously. They didn't dwell on our shortcomings&ndash;math, science, Latin. We were never described as aspiring. Michael was a writer, Meg an actress, Nell a scientist. I was an artist. Our titles expanded as our interests grew. Ultimately, three out of the four of us became writers. My parents became the models for Lucy Rose's grandparents, Madam and Pop.<br><br><b>How did you get into writing professionally?</b><br><br>I was working as an illustrator and walking the floors with our darling, relentlessly colicky baby when a friend called to ask if I would like a two-day-a-week job doing basic research and phone answering at <i>People </i>magazine. I would have done it for free.<br><br>I started covering parties for <i>People </i>and graduated to bigger stories. Six years and another baby later, I was hired as a feature writer for <i>USA Today's</i> Life section. Reporting taught me to write fast and to be frugal with words, and it let me ask questions that would be rude under any other circumstances. I spent time in Hollywood with movie stars, in Washington with the president, and in Mississippi with people who lived in houses that rented for $60 a month. No plumbing, no electricity, one good wind from toppling over. I learned to listen to what people were (and weren' t) saying, to understand what they cherished and what they feared. I can't imagine that I could write good fiction without having reported on so many real lives.<br><b><br>Where do you get your ideas?</b><br>In schools, on the subway, in the market. Something happens and it triggers an idea. My first book, <i>Lucy Rose: Here's the Thing About Me, </i>came about when, one night at family dinner, my mom said about her dog, ""Poppy has been so much better since I've been telling her where I'm going and what time I'll be back."" That struck me as hilarious. After they left, I typed the words: ""My grandmother thinks her dog can tell time."" The story took off from there. Until my mom said that I hadn't thought about writing a children's book. I tell aspiring writers to eavesdrop. It's a great way to get ideas and to get a sense of how people really talk. When you have something, write it down as soon as you can.<br><br><b>How do you write?</b><br>I follow the advice of that old Nike ad: Just Do It. Lots of people think about writing a book but say, ""I don't have time,"" or ""I'm waiting for inspiration,"" or ""I want to get it worked out in my head first."" If you want to write, carve out the time. If you write a page a day in a year you'll have the first draft of a novel.<br><br><b>What are the biggest writing mistakes people make?</b><br>Thinking bigger words are better words, becoming wedded to every word so they can't bear to throw anything out. Many writers repeat themselves. Say it once. Readers are smart. They remember.<br><br><b>How do you sharpen your work?</b><br>What works best for me is to write a bit, edit, make changes, write some more, and repeat from the beginning. When I finish a piece, I go through it once just to find and banish clich&eacute;s. Then I run a search for the words very and really. They take up space and almost never help the writing. I read my work out loud. That is the surest, quickest way to tell if the voices ring true or the writing is lumpy.<br><br><b>Who are you favorite writers?</b><br>I have many. Katharine Patterson, Judy Blume, Lois Lowery, Dick King-Smith, P. G. Wodehouse, Ian Falconer, S. E. Hinton, Harper Lee, Daniel Wallace.<br><br><b>Your favorite book?</b><br>I can't pick a favorite. But I am in awe of Ernest Hemingway's six word short story: ""For sale: Baby shoes, never worn."" <br><br><b>Do you start with an outline?</b><br>No. But I do make a list of five or six things that are going to happen. Sometimes I change my mind, but the list gives me some direction.<br><br><b>Are Washington, D.C., and Capitol Hill like they are in the Lucy Rose and Melonhead books?</b><br>The neighborhood has been gentrified, but it is still full of families and dogs and shops and adventures. (Almost all of the places in the book are real.) When we were young, my brother and sisters and I spent our days roaming around the Capitol, playing pick-up soccer on the Library of Congress lawn and dropping in on the Smithsonian museums. We regularly climbed the 897 steps to the top of the Washington Monument and took so many tours of the FBI that the guides recognized us. When my dad was a young reporter, he used to meet Harry Truman at Union (train) Station and they' d do the interview while they walked. Washington is less free-wheeling now. Security is tighter, kids can't tour the FBI without an adult, you have to go through your Congressperson to get a White House ticket, and you have to take the elevator to the top of the Washington Monument. <br><br><b>Your family has lived on the same block of Constitution Avenue for generations.</b><br><br>It's been a good place to chart change. My dad was born at home in 1923. One of his earliest memories is seeing the KKK march past the house in 1925. He was two years old. In August 1963, when I was seven, thousands of people in the March on Washington walked the same route to hear Dr. King deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. My mom was days away from having my sister Nell, and her obstetrician wouldn't allow her to walk that far. Instead she, my brother Michael, my sister Meg, and I passed out free lemonade and cookies all day. (My dad was reporting on the March for the <i>Washington Daily News</i>.) In January 2009 all of us, including my eight-year-old nephew watched hundreds of thousands of people walk past the house on the way to see President Obama get inaugurated.<br><b><br>Out of four Kelly kids, three became writers. What do they do?</b><br>My sister Meg is a screenwriter. For years she wrote for soap operas. Until recently she was the co-headwriter for <i>Days of Our Lives</i>.<br><br>My brother Michael reported for the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>New Yorker</i> and the <i>National Journal</i>. He was a syndicated columnist, the author of <i>Martyr's Day</i> and the editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. It is the great heartbreak of our lives that Michael was killed while reporting on the first days of the war in Iraq in 2003.<br><br>My sister Nell has the most important job in the family. She teaches kindergarten and first grade.<br><br><b>What do you tell kids who want to be writers?</b><br>Do it! I've met a lot of artists and singers and writers who were going to college to study business or teaching or dental hygiene. People, often parents, have convinced them that their passion is too risky for real life. Pursue the practical, they say, you can always sing in the church choir, paint on the side, write in your off-hours. Though said with love, this is lousy advice. Passions almost always stem from talent. And when you're talented and work hard, you get jobs.<br><br><b>How did you get your book published?</b><br>After I finished, I sent it to four agents. I have still not heard back from them. It was my great good fortune to have a friend who passed my manuscript on to his editor. That said, I do believe good books get published, just not as fast as one hopes.<br><br><b>What can a children's book writer do to find a publisher?</b><br>Join the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. They have groups all over the country. Go to their workshops. Make contacts. Have faith.<br><br><b>Fun facts about Katy Kelly:</b><br><br>She has two children, Emily and Marguerite.<br><br>She married her college sweetheart. His name is Steve.<br><br>She has a dog named Ellie. When Katy was a kid, she had a big, black French Poodle named Gumbo. He appears in the Lucy Rose and Melonhead books.<br><br>She lives in Washington, D.C.<br><br>She loves visiting schools.<br><br>She spends much of her money at bookstores.<br><br>She is wild for ice cream and chocolate and especially chocolate ice cream.<br><br>She is anti-cauliflower.<br><br>She draws and paints.<br><br>Her office is in her house. It is pink and green and jazzy.<br><br>If she could choose one extra talent, it would be singing. <br><br>Her mom, Marguerite Kelly, is the author of <i>The Mother's Almanac</i>.<br><br>Madam and Pop are now celebrities in their neighborhood.<br><br><b>About the author</b><br>Katy Kelly is the daughter of writers. She and her siblings grew up on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., five blocks away from the U.S. Capitol, four from the Senate buildings, and three from the U.S. Supreme Court.<br>She was a reporter and editor for 20 years before becoming an author."

I grew up in a word-loving environment. My father is the king of puns, spoonerisms, and wordplay. The idea of a character named Precious Darling was intriguing. Would she be precious? Or darling? Of course not. Life rarely works out that way. Precious Darling and her equally ironically named sisters stuck with me and begged me to write about them. (Of course they did. They&#8217;re that vain!) Other characters I write about have more realistic roots. Libby, the main character in the story, is a cross between several strong young people I&#8217;ve known over the years. Frannie, Libby&#8217;s little sister, is very much like a precocious and always-entertaining young lady who is growing up my house. <br><br>I&#8217;ve spent the second half my life-so-far on a farm. I grew up with farming relatives, but my family and I lived in the suburbs. I spent a lot of summer days visiting my cousin&#8217;s dairy farm, searching the haymow for new kittens and learning to walk barefooted in manure. I didn&#8217;t always love the farm animals. I used to have nightmares about huge Holstein cows walking up my driveway. When I went to college and met the farmer of my dreams, I knew I&#8217;d have to face my animal fears head on. Those big, old steers can still make me take a step backwards (away from their back end), but I&#8217;ve grown to respect them. <br><br>I&#8217;m always so impressed when I watch young people with their livestock at a county fair. The level of maturity, the amount of time and energy, and the physical nature of the work they do are amazing. (Not to mention, it&#8217;s just a dirty and sometimes stinky job to clean up after farm animals.) But there is nothing quite like auction night. The lights, the auctioneer&#8217;s booming song, the ringman&#8217;s yelping call to signal a bid, the pacing animals in the ring, and most of all, the youngsters at the other end of the lead rope. The emotions on their faces are as mixed as the feelings in their hearts. Pride. They&#8217;ve raised an outstanding, functional animal. Excitement. It&#8217;s the night they&#8217;ve worked for all year. Heartbreak. In minutes, it&#8217;ll be over. It will be time to say goodbye. <br><br>When I wrote about this in <i>The Beef Princess of Practical County</i>, my editor asked me what I suppose anyone who hasn&#8217;t experienced farm life would ask. Why? Why do the kids do it again and again if it&#8217;s such a painful life experience? That was my challenge in completing the book. How will Libby face the auction ring? Will she even face it at all? Writing is about living, and living is about growing and making decisions that ring true to your own beliefs. Libby may have faced some of the toughest decisions she ever had to make, but she always remained true to herself. Even in the presence of the dreaded, ditzy Darling sisters. And that&#8217;s no bull!"

Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: ""I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!""

I&#8217;m excited that my students will see me as a real live writer, and I will be thrilled if more of them are inspired to carry on independent writing lives. But I wonder how they and their parents will react to the fact that the book deals so openly with the kinds of things teenage boys think about. Just imagine parent-teacher conferences, if you will: <br> <br><b>PARENT #1</b>: So, Jake, we read your book.<br><br><b>ME</b> (<i>smiling nervously)</i>: Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you how Becky is doing in class. Her writing is&#8211;<br><br><b>PARENT #2 </b><i>(holding up a copy)</i>: Masturbation. Drug use. Pornography. You seem quite well versed in these subjects . . .<br><br>You get the idea. So to the question of how much of <i>Spanking Shakespeare</i> is autobiographical, let me just say that nothing has ever been proven. And as to the rumors that I&#8217;m now working on a musical called <i>Castration Celebration</i>, I&#8217;ll have to plead the fifth."

In fact, aside from a brief flirtation with the idea of being a veterinarian when I was four, being a professional writer has been my ultimate dream job (and, for that matter, my ultimate dream) for more or less my entire life. Along with my dislike of chocolate (I know, I&#8217;m a freak) and my love of all things sparkly, my passion for fiction&#8211;books, television, movies, and more&#8211;has probably been one of my most enduring character traits, and one of the ones that has most defined me as a person.<br><br>The summer I was 19, I wrote <i>Golden</i>, the story of a girl named Lissy who moves cross-country and lands right smack dab in the middle of the world&#8217;s scariest and most intimidating high school social hierarchy. Like Lissy, I changed schools at the start of my high school career. Unlike Lissy, however, I had to find my place at my new school without the aid of any kind of supernatural power.<br><br>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with the supernatural. When I was little, I used to watch <i>Bewitched</i> on television and wonder why it didn&#8217;t work when I twitched my own nose. In the third grade, I read Roald Dahl&#8217;s <i>Matilda</i> and spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to move things with the power of my mind. I love mythology, fairy tales, ghost stories, and the idea that there might be more out there than any of us can logically explain.<br><br>When I sit down to write a book, I usually start out with a supernatural concept&#8211;like aura vision or the idea of mystical tattoos capable of giving their wearers super powers&#8211;and then I think about my own experiences in life and try to identify an aspect of teen experience that fits with that particular slice of the supernatural. In <i>Golden</i>, Lissy&#8217;s ability to see auras gives her insight into the behavior of others, so I chose to throw her into the world of high school cliques, where her power would be both a blessing and a curse. <br><br>All of my characters lead double lives as normal teens in the every day teen world that have to deal with some pretty fantastical things. In many ways, I relate. Not because I have powers of my own (sadly, if I do have any super powers, they are as yet unidentified), but because throughout college, I lived my own double life&#8211;as a novelist and a student. I loved Yale, and didn&#8217;t want to miss out on any of my four years there, so more often than not, I was a college student by day and a writer by night, doing most of my writing between two and four in the morning, after everyone else had gone to sleep.<br><br>I&#8217;m a big believer that a writer has to be, first and foremost, a person who is out there in the world, experiencing life, and that is exactly what I try to do."

A pessimistic but convincing guidance counselor who said, &#8220;But what&#8217;s going to be your <i>day job</i>?&#8221; So, I picked something that sounded interesting, then loaded up on electives. My transcript is all over the place, and I had a blast learning new things. Researching my books is like staying in school forever, but without as many final exams and keg parties.<br><br>MQ: Speaking of jobs, you have a really random collection of hobbies and skills. <br><br>RCM: I&#8217;m a fifth generation Texas rancher on one side, and a first generation American on the other. Being the child of a cowboy and a city girl contributes to my weirdness. I can ride, shoot, sail, tie knots, pitch a tent, and build a campfire and then cook on it. I can also serve high tea, embroider and sew, tap dance, and sing random selections from Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. I love history, archeology, literature, ballet, musical theater, horses, and dogs. Plus the whole sci-fi/fantasy obsession. <br><br>MQ: Did you always want to write for teens? <br><br>RCM: That&#8217;s just how it turned out. I enjoy stories about discovering your talents, and how you&#8217;re going to use them to save the world, sometimes literally. <br><br>MQ: Yeah, what&#8217;s up with that? Monsters and demons? Evil cheerleaders? Do you keep yourself up at night? <br><br>RCM: Well, I don&#8217;t believe in literal monsters and demons, just figurative ones, which are even more frightening. It&#8217;s scary to realize that horrific things like the Holocaust or 9/11 or the Virginia Tech shootings aren&#8217;t caused by supernatural forces, but by human beings. Giving evil a face and defeating it in fiction is very satisfying.<br>The good/evil line isn&#8217;t as clear-cut when it doesn't involve automatic weapons. Sometimes the little decisions&#8211;kind words over hateful ones, unprompted generosity, honesty when no one is watching&#8211;are harder than the big obvious ones. But I think they&#8217;re just as important, which is why my characters are often faced with the choice of doing the easy thing, or doing the right thing. <br><br>MQ: Way to bring things down. Let&#8217;s lighten it up a little. Why give up your glamorous job as a youth theater director for writing books?<br><br>RCM: Well, you don&#8217;t have to worry about a special effects budget in a book. You can do whatever you want. You can also go anywhere, be anything or anyone&#8211;the same things that appeal to me about drama, except I don&#8217;t have to stay on a diet, and I get to work on the couch, wearing my Starfleet Academy sweatshirt. Though the puppy in my lap does make it hard to type sometimes.<br><br>MQ: I have to say, your dog, Lizzie, is probably the cutest dog on the planet. <br><br>RCM: How nice of you to agree with me!"

Among her earliest acquaintances were cows, goats, ducks, chickens, rabbits, dogs, cats, and horses. In fact, her family&rsquo;s animals were her closest friends, and a nearby library was a constant source of magic, adventure, and excitement for her.&nbsp;

Snyder attended Whittier College in Southern California, which awarded her an honorary doctorate. There she also met her future husband, Larry Snyder. While ultimately planning to be a writer, after graduation Snyder decided to teach school temporarily. But she found teaching to be an extremely rewarding experience and taught in the upper elementary grades for a total of nine years, three of them as a master teacher for the University of California at Berkeley.&nbsp;

In the early sixties, when all of her children were finally in school, Snyder began to think about writing again. &ldquo;Writing for children hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me when I was younger, but nine years of teaching in the upper elementary grades had given me a deep appreciation of the gifts and graces that are specific to individuals with 10 or 11 years of experience as human beings. Remembering a dream I&rsquo;d had when I was 12 years old about some strange and wonderful horses, I sat down and began to write.&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>Season of Ponies</i>, Snyder&rsquo;s first book, was published in 1964.

Snyder&rsquo;s novel,&nbsp;<i>Gib Rides Home</i>, is a vivid look at the life of an orphan in prairie country almost a century ago. The book was inspired by Snyder&rsquo;s father, who grew up in a Nebraska orphanage and was farmed out as labor on nearby ranches."

The assignments first given to Scarry tended to be Little Golden Books that featured popular characters of the day, such as Winky Dink, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Smokey the Bear. Eventually, Scarry created his own original characters, such as Lowly Worm and Huckle Cat. But first came Nicholas, a young rabbit clad in red overalls, for the now-iconic classic&#160;<i>I Am a Bunny</i>. <br><br>In his extraordinary career, Richard Scarry illustrated more than 150 books, many of which have never been out of print.

My relatives, who were dynamic and skilled storytellers, helped develop my listening and observation skills before I could read or write.<br><br>On hot summer evenings our family would sit on the porch and listen to my grandmother tell a hair-raising ghost story, or my mother would recite Dunbar poems or Bible stories. Sometimes we&#8217;d get a real treat when my grandfather would dramatize an episode from his childhood, told in the rich and colorful dialect of the Deep South. I can still hear him beginning a yarn, saying: &#8220;It was back in nineteen and twenty-seven. I disremember the exact day, but it was long &#8217;bout July, &#8217;cause the skeeters was bitin&#8217; whole chunks outta my arms. . . .&#8221;<br><br>As a youngster I had no idea that my heritage would one day be the springboard for my writing career.<br><br>Somewhere around age seven I discovered reading. And so began my lifelong love affair with the printed word. To me, reading is like breathing; both are essential to life.<br><br>I grew up, went off to school, majored in English literature, acquired a teaching certificate, and married right after graduation. (They said the marriage wouldn&#8217;t last six months. . . .) I knew then I wanted to be a writer. But the children came&#8212;one, and two and three together. Not much time for writing.<br><br>The library was my lifesaver. Besides being free, air-conditioned, and quiet, it was a wonderful place to learn my trade. There I learned to identify the complex reading/interest levels in children&#8217;s literature from beginning reader through young adult books. My reading included publishers&#8217; catalogs, writers&#8217; magazines, and book reviews. And whenever time and money would permit, I&#8217;d attend a seminar or workshop, often taking all three children with me. That&#8217;s where I heard about keeping a journal and the benefits of belonging to a literary organization. My parenting period turned out to be a very productive time for the kids and me. I didn&#8217;t publish anything, but my spirits were high and my determination steadfast. And the boys turned out to be excellent readers and writers.<br><br>My sons grew out of diapers and into size eight shoes; I grew out of size eight jeans and into size twelve business suits. Then, after nine years of teaching junior high and senior high English and after earning a master&#8217;s degree in children&#8217;s literature, I changed careers and became a children&#8217;s book editor. Six years later I became a freelance writer. A year later my husband Fred joined me, and we&#8217;ve been writing together since then. On days when I get a rejection slip&#8212;oh yes, I still get them&#8212;I close up shop and work with my flowers or go antique shopping. Then it&#8217;s back to more writing and &#8220;yesterday&#8221; deadlines.<br><br>I enjoy teaching other people to write too. What better way to combine all my training as teacher and writer? For the past ten years I&#8217;ve been teaching a course in writing for children at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. One of the greatest joys is seeing a student&#8217;s face when he or she tells me, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just sold a story!&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t happen often, but when it does, it&#8217;s great!<br><br>I&#8217;m reminded of the day my editor, Anne Schwartz, told me <i>Flossie and the Fox</i> was going to be published. I squealed for joy! When <i>Mirandy and Brother Wind</i> was accepted, Anne knew to hold the telephone away from her ear. The delight of selling a book has never diminished&#8212;and I hope it never does.<br><br>I write because there&#8217;s a clear <i>need</i> for books written about the minority experience in America&#8212;fiction and nonfiction.

Was it difficult to write another novel following that?</b><br>It&rsquo;s very easy for a first time novelist to feel like an impostor, to fret that everyone who has shown faith in them will soon realise that they&rsquo;ve made a horrible mistake and that coming up with a second novel is completely out of the question. I spent a lot of time worrying instead of writing. <br>&#160;<br><b>Both of your young adult novels broach difficult subjects&mdash;the terminal illness of a teen in <i>Before I Die</i> and sexual assault in <i>You Against Me</i>. What is it that draws you to tackle such weighty topics?</b><br>I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t seem to help it. I don&rsquo;t really think in terms of themes or topics when I begin a project; I&rsquo;m more interested in characters and the stories they have to tell. I seem to have a tendency to be drawn to the extraordinary in the everyday and vice versa. In <i>Before I Die,</i> the protagonist is dying, but the novel is actually an examination of what it means to be alive. In <i>You Against Me</i>, there has been an allegation of sexual assault, but at the book&rsquo;s heart is a love story. <br>&#160;<br><b>What inspired you to write <i>You Against Me</i>?</b><br>I actually knew very little when I started writing. I had a few ideas, but they were abstract, theoretical, as if I knew the tone of the piece, but nothing else. I always use free writing techniques when I start a new book, which is a bit like improvising in theatre&mdash;throwing words down and not planning anything in advance. Most of it goes in the bin, but the strongest themes and voices keep returning. <br>&#160;<br>After months of this, I began to know more. I was haunted by a small seaside town, by a girl called Karyn who alleged something terrible had happened to her and by her brother, Mikey, who was out for revenge.<br>&#160;<br><b>Your new novel handles a very tough topic that effects many teens. What was that responsibility like and how did it inform your writing?</b><br>I often felt overwhelmed with responsibility. I didn&rsquo;t want any girl or young woman to pick&#160;up my book and think after reading it that they shouldn&rsquo;t&#160;bother reporting an assault, and yet I wanted the novel to accurately reflect the very difficult realities of&#160;prosecuting a case such as this.<br>&#160;<br>I tried not to let my fear inform the writing. The danger was that I would hold back on tackling anything too difficult in case I offended anyone. To counter the fear, I interviewed criminal lawyers, social workers, family support workers and police officers. I watched court cases and read lots of books. The research really grounded the novel, but it slowed me down a lot too. When the first draft was finished, every single one of the people who helped me with research read it and gave feedback. I wanted any gender bias or prejudice to come from the characters, not from the author. I wanted to be sure I wasn&rsquo;t perpetuating any myths or stereotypes around sexual assault.<br>&#160;<br><b>Were there any other young adult works that you found particularly helpful or inspirational while working on <i>You Against Me</i>?</b><br>I tend to steer away from fiction that is thematically similar when I am writing. I stick to nonfiction books about the subject instead. <br><br><b>The two main characters of <i>You Against Me</i> are not directly involved in the incident that the book centers around. Did you know from the beginning that you would tell the story from the perspectives of Mikey and Ellie, the siblings of the victim and the accused?</b><br>I originally started writing from Karyn&rsquo;s point of view, but it became clear quite quickly that her perspective was too &ldquo;hot.&rdquo; In fact, she was a very unreliable narrator, often unwilling and mostly silent, almost as if she didn&rsquo;t want to be in the story. At that point, her brother Mikey took over the narrative. In fact he ran with it. He was determined to avenge his sister and all I had to do was follow him.<br>&#160;<br>I loved writing Mikey because he was a mass of contradictions&mdash;he&rsquo;d left school with limited prospects, yet was hugely ambitious. The main carer for his family, he also managed to juggle a complicated love life. Bright, but often inarticulate, he had an innate distrust of authority, yet his family were dependent on police and social workers for support.<br>&#160;<br>I thought I&rsquo;d found the book&rsquo;s narrative voice, but then Ellie appeared&mdash;clever, determined Ellie. She&rsquo;d recently moved to the area and had no friends yet. She did, however, have a brother and she certainly seemed to know a lot more than she was saying about what had happened to Mikey&rsquo;s sister. <br>&#160;<br>With two voices, a more complex narrative began to emerge. I also knew that being one step back from what happened was a more interesting way to tackle the subject of assault and all the prejudice that surrounds it. <br>&#160;<br><b>While dealing with sexual assault, <i>You Against Me</i> is much more than an &ldquo;issues&rdquo; book. Was the theme of finding love in unexpected places something that evolved during the course of your writing?</b><br><i>You Against Me</i> is a love story, but the love is fought for under very difficult circumstances. It&rsquo;s also about truth, about looking at someone you know really well and wondering if you know them at all. Those two threads evolved quite quickly as I wrote. &#160;I don&rsquo;t want my job as a writer to be about looking at &ldquo;issues&rdquo; or giving moral guidance. Teens don&rsquo;t want to read about things adults think are good for them, or about how they <i>ought</i> to behave. <br>&#160;<br>Of course, books can address difficult situations and confront social issues and help readers deal with real-life challenges. They can transport you, make you think, move you . . . the list is endless. Ultimately though, it&rsquo;s the story&mdash;with all its complexities, with the emotional truths it uncovers, the experiences beyond the everyday that it gives, that will be the real reason why young people read.<br>&#160;<br><b>The Parkers and the McKenzies are from different social classes. What inspired you to have these families, and Mikey and Ellie, come from such varied worlds?</b><br>I know it sounds odd, but I have no clue about character, geography, social class, or anything else when I begin a novel. After months of generating material, I begin to get a clearer idea of what a book might be about. I guess I had Romeo and Juliet in the back of my mind because I was interested in loving someone forbidden. But I also had Hamlet in my mind&mdash;something rotten in your own family.<br>&#160;<br>It was important to me that my two central protagonists would never have met under normal circumstances. I wanted them to have to tackle their own prejudices about each others&rsquo; backgrounds, as well as their preconceptions about the assault. I wanted them to fall in love &ldquo;despite themselves.&rdquo;<br><i>&#160;</i><br><b>What do you hope that readers come away with after reading <i>You Against Me</i>?</b><br>I was attempting to write a good story, one that moved readers emotionally, but also made them think. I hope that the book encourages debate for the very reason that I am <i>not </i>telling anyone what the right answers are."

You&#8217;ve written on a wide variety of topics. Where do you get your ideas?<br></i></b><br>Honestly, ideas are everywhere: in books I read, in people I talk to, in my own household and neighborhood. The challenge is to capture them and mold them into a story that will both entertain and inform my readers. I don&#8217;t have a standard method of choosing which ideas I will turn into books . . . it&#8217;s more like the ideas choose me! For example, my first novel, <i>The Trial</i>, began as I was writing a series of poems (which I intended to send to magazines) about the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and murder case. Before I knew it, I had put everything else aside and was really delving into the facts and myths about the investigation and the trial. A brief visit back to my hometown of Flemington, New Jersey, where the 1935 trial took place, convinced me that I should try and tell the whole story in a verse novel.<br><br><b><i>2. You wrote more than a dozen biographies before turning to fiction. How did that experience affect your later writings?<br></i></b><br>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with real events and real people&#8211;and I find them frequently more interesting and more bizarre than anything I could ever make up. I also love to research&#8211;and by that I mean I love to hunt for interesting and little-known facts. The research process is never boring! I travel to museums, archives, and small towns where significant events took place (such as the Scopes Monkey trial in Dayton, Tennessee); I go to plays and watch movies; I interview famous people and witnesses to history; I read historical documents, books, magazines, and web pages. <br><br>3. <b><i>Your third novel, Pieces of Georgia, is a 13-year old girl&#8217;s journal about her dead mother, her still-grieving father, her athletic best friend, and her own desire to become an artist. How did you create this character&#8211;and why did you have her live on a horse farm?<br></i></b><br>Many aspect of my own life came crashing together in that book. When I was a teenager, I spent many Saturdays on a horse farm in central New Jersey, and I used those memories to create the setting for <i>Pieces of Georgia.</i> I also grew up next to a funeral home (my father and grandfather were undertakers), so I had a lot of opportunity to observe how grief and loss affect different people. I participated in three sports in high school, but still had a lot of free time to explore other interests. Now, however, sports have become year-round and hyper-competitive and so I created Georgia&#8217;s friend Tiffany to represent the difficulties that teens today must deal with if they&#8217;re into sports. Lastly, I didn&#8217;t go to school for writing, so I had to engage in a lot of trial-and-error to find my own style and voice. In <i>Pieces of Georgia</i>, that&#8217;s exactly how Georgia goes about learning how to draw. <br><br> 4. <b><i>Tell us about your recent novel</i></b> <b><i>Kaleidoscope Eyes.</i></b><br><br>The main plot involves three friends who stumble onto a set of maps they suspect may lead them to one of the buried treasures of the notorious pirate Captain Kidd. (I started this book long before the recent events involving modern pirates starting appearing in the news!) The story takes place in 1968, in a small town in southern New Jersey. The entire &#8216;60s decade was turbulent, but that year was especially so: we had the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the peak of the Vietnam War, and hundreds of antiwar protests and sit-ins. There were huge rock concerts and drug use was rampant. Civil rights and women&#8217;s rights were gaining momentum, but there remained many parts of society who were violently opposed to both. So&#8211;in a way, it&#8217;s a 17th-century pirate tale embedded in a 1960&#8217;s rock &#8217;n&#8217; roll era story. It was a lot of fun to research, and hopefully even more fun to read!<br><br><br><b><i>OTHER FAQs:</i></b><br><br><b><i>Where were you born?<br></i></b><br>Easton, Pennsylvania . . . but I only lived there for a few weeks.

I also love to read good poetry, fiction, and biographies and to watch movies with my family. When I travel, I enjoy visiting museums&#8211;especially the smaller and more unusual ones. The Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C., and the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore are two of my favorites.

Of course, even though I can go anywhere I want with the story, I write out of the historical background.&#8221; Ultimately, he says &#8220;my job as a writer is to make each book very exciting so the kids are going to stay with it.&#8221;<br><br>The Collier brothers have written <i>With Every Drop of Blood.</i> This powerful story takes place in the last days of the Civil War, when a Rebel boy is captured by a runaway slave who is now a Yankee soldier.
